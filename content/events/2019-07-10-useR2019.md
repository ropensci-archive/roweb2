Three members of the rOpenSci team - Scott Chamberlain, Jenny Bryan, and Rich FitzJohn - as well as many community members will give talks at [useR!2019](http://www.user2019.fr/). Many other package authors, maintainers, reviewers and unconf participants will be there too. Don't hesitate to ask them about rOpenSci [packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/), [software peer review](https://ropensci.org/software-review/), [community](https://ropensci.org/community/), or just say hello if you're looking for a friendly face.

We've listed their talks for you in a [blog post](/blog/2019/07/08/user2019/). Search the [schedule](https://connect.rstudioservices.com/content/331/user2019-schedule.html) for details.
