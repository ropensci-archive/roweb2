rOpenSci [Software Peer Review](/software-review/) Editor Anna Krystalli will be presenting [pkgreviewr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkgreviewr), an R package that helps automate some of the steps and guide reviewers through the rOpenSci review process. In her poster she’ll present an overview of the rOpenSci review process and the use of pkgreviewr to support it. She’ll also tell the story of how the package came to be and how such contributions can lead to deeper involvement with the community.
