rOpenSci [Software Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/software-review/) Editor Anna Krystalli will be presenting [pkgreviewr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkgreviewr), an R package that helps automate some of the steps and guide reviewers through the rOpenSci review process. In her poster sheâ€™ll present an overview of the rOpenSci review process and the use of pkgreviewr to support it. Sheâ€™ll also tell the story of how the package came to be and how such contributions can lead to deeper involvement with the community.
