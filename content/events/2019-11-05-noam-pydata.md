Noam Ross, rOpenSci Software Peer Review Editor and Leadership Team member, is talking about [Building Software and Communities With Peer Review](https://pydata.org/nyc2019/schedule/presentation/73/building-software-and-communities-with-peer-review/) at PyData.

### Description
Software peer review can improve software quality, accelerate the adoption of best practices and community standards, and build communities of practice. I will present lessons from over four years of software peer review at rOpenSci, and new initiatives such as pyOpenSci that are expanding software peer review into new fields and languages.

### Abstract
Code review is a common practice in software engineering, and peer review is a key mechanism of quality control and validation in scientific publication. Peer review of scientific code, however, is rare. rOpenSci, a developer's collective that creates software to support scientific reproducibility, has developed a system for software peer review that has enabled us to build a trusted collection of over 120 software packages in the past four years.

In this presentation I will describe our review approach and the lessons we've learned, including the surprising outcomes and benefits of fully open review. Software peer review not only enables quality control: we have found it an excellent mechanism for seeding new collaborations and communities, for building consensus on standards, and pushing best practices out into a community much wider than our own authors and reviewers. These benefits come from careful design and maintenance of both technical and social systems. I will discuss these designs and how they can be integrated into other projects and communities, and explain how new authors and reviewers can navigate software peer-review in projects such as rOpenSci, pyOpenSci, or the Journal of Open-Source Software.

This talk is for anyone interested in getting involved in software peer review as an author or a reviewer, or bringing software peer review to their own teams.
