While many people groan at the thought of participating in a group ice breaker activity, we've gotten consistent feedback from people who have been to recent rOpenSci unconferences.

> Best ice breaker ever!

We've had lots of requests for a detailed description of how we do it. This post shares our recipe, including a script you can adapt, tips, examples of where others have used it, and thoughts on its success. Let us know in the comments if you've used or adapted it!


## The Choice
I knew we would have a group of 60 to 70 people at [unconf17](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017/), most of whom didn't now each other. My objective was to have everyone introduce themselves to the entire group, and I wanted them to have "real" conversations, since immediately following the ice breaker, people would be self-sorting into groups who would collaborate on projects for two days.

After participating in several different flavors of ice breakers with a group of scientific community engagement managers, I chose an exercise called the "Human Barometer", recommended by [Cameron Neylon](https://twitter.com/cameronneylon). There are a number of examples of the Human Barometer like [this one](https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/teaching-strategies/barometer-taking-stand-controversial-issues) online and it's worth having a look to get a sense of the variations.

## The Script
*Ask participants to stand in a line shoulder-to-shoulder facing you. This isn't important after the start but helps people figure out the process.*

The objective of this icebreaker is to have all of you interacting across all perceived levels of who an rOpenSci unconf participant is. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to go down.

I‚Äôm going to make a potentially controversial statement and then ask you to stand on the spot on the line that reflects your opinion on the continuum between two extremes. For example, if you strongly agree with a statement, you would walk over and stand on your far right. If you strongly disagree, you would walk over to your far left, and many people will stand somewhere in between.

Once you‚Äôve settled, I‚Äôll give you three minutes to talk with the people around you to share opinions on the statement giving evidence or an example that supports your opinion. Then, I‚Äôll ask for volunteers to introduce themselves to the entire group and share their opinions and evidence. Your challenge is to see if you can change people's minds about where they're standing.

Please be sure to say both your first and last name regardless of how recognizable some people think you are. Also be aware that people may have different preferred pronouns. For example, when you‚Äôre talking about me behind my back üòâ, please refer to me as she or her. Someone else might prefer to be referred to as they or them and I hope that people feel comfortable enough here to tell us your preferred pronouns.

Let‚Äôs begin‚Ä¶

> Question 1: In the R community there are people who identify as #RDogLadies and #RCatFellas (and #RDogFellas and #RCatLadies). So ‚Ä¶ if you are a cat lover, move to your right and if you‚Äôre a dog person stand over here to your left. People agnostic to these animals, or those who identify as #RChickenLadies, should migrate to the middle.

*Prior to the icebreaker I recruited two people who had extreme different opinions to illustrate how the ice breaker would work. rOpenSci's co-founder [Scott Chamberlain](https://twitter.com/sckottie) is an avowed cat person.*

*Timed 3-minute chat among people standing near each other*

Please introduce yourself and tell us why you have chosen to stand where you are standing...

Does anyone wish to move based on what you‚Äôve heard?

> Question 2: When I need to do something I‚Äôve never done before, I a) consult an outside authority e.g. read the documentation or talk to an expert and try to understand the big picture OR b) I try to find a working example and modify it for my purposes

*Continue with brief introductions to the entire group for 10 to 12 minutes for each question*

> Question 3: I know where I fit as a member of the R community (agree vs disagree)

*Near end of the exercise, ask anyone who did not speak up to introduce themselves to the group.*

## Reflecting on the success of this ice breaker:

> Really work on the questions - they're the key to shifting it from being an ok ice breaker to a really provocative and useful workshop starter. Think about the questions that underpin the workshop, what are the issues people are worried about but unsure how to raise? Can you frame a slightly humorous question that makes it ok to talk about? - Cameron Neylon

The ‚ÄúI know where I fit as a member of the R community‚Äù question was ideal coming at the end of the ice breaker because people had become comfortable with the flow of discussion and were willing to be a bit more vulnerable and share slightly more personal opinions. Someone noted that despite having equal representation of women and men in the group there was a much larger proportion of women who indicated ‚ÄúI don't know where I fit in the R community‚Äù. One acknowledged expert had themselves standing at the ‚ÄúI don't know where I fit in the R community‚Äù end, and they indicated that this was because they suffered from imposter syndrome. This gave me an opportunity to explain [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and subsequently, when we polled the entire group, two thirds said they identified with it!

This exercise was the perfect segue into the project group self-selection and eased the way for plenty of informal conversations later in the day.

This photo may look like a "we're a happy community" picture, but it's actually the response to "who here feels like they have imposter syndrome"?

## Who else in our community has used it?
Some people who participated in this ice breaker at our unconferences have adapted it for their own events.

- Julia Stewart-Lowndes at xxx
- [Reka Solymosi](https://twitter.com/r_solymosi) used it with (insert # people) at welcome week activities for graduate students in Criminology and Social Statistics at the University of Manchester
- [Miles McBain](https://twitter.com/milesmcbain) used it with 35 people at the 2018 [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) Summit
- [Sam Albers](https://twitter.com/big_bad_sam) used it with 30 people at an ____ event/workshop for the ____ (e.g. R users in the British Columbia government dept xyz)
- [Nick Tierney](https://twitter.com/nj_tierney) used it with 45 people at [ozunconf17](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/31/ozunconf2017/)

## Tips
1. Work hard to design questions that relate to your community and event. Start with a frivolous question and then dig deep.
1. Write a script for yourself; it forces you to think through the excercise.
1. Explain how the exercise works and find two volunteers to demonstrate
1. Use a timer to limit the small-group introductions to ~3 minutes and limit the exercise to 45 to 60 minutes.
1. Encourage people to introduce themselves using first and last names; it helps minimize assumptions about who everyone ought to know
1. Visually keep track of who has not yet spoken up and call on them at the end. (A strong memory for faces and names helps.)
