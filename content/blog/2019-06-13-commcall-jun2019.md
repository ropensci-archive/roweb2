rOpenSci’s community is increasingly international and multilingual. While we have operated primarily in English, we now receive submissions of packages from authors whose primary language is not. As we expand our community in this way, we want to learn from the experience of other organizations. How can we manage our peer-review process and open-source projects to be welcoming to non-native English speakers?

Our guest speakers will include:

- Rayna Harris, who has co-led work with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) in internationalization of curricula.
- Emilio Bruna, who as editor-in-chief of [Biotropica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17447429), manages a journal with a heavily tropical-country audience and authorship base.

The call will be moderated by Melina Vidoni, an associate editor for rOpenSci [software peer review](/software-review/). There will be 20 minutes for Q & A following the presentations.

We want to hear from you!

> What has been useful or not useful in building mutlilingual communities and projects you have been involved in?

> In what ways is language a barrier to your becoming more involved with organizations like rOpenSci?

Add your comments below and we’ll organize our panel questions and topics around your contributions and questions.

🎤 See speaker bios below.
