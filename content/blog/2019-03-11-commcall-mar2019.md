Our next Community Call, on March 27th, aims to help people learn about using rOpenSci's R packages to access and analyze taxonomy and biodiversity data, and to recognize the breadth and depth of their applications. We also aim to learn from the discussion how we might improve these tools. Presentations will start with an introduction to the topic and details on some specific packages and we'll hear from several people about their "use cases in the wild".

#### Agenda

1. Stefanie Butland - welcome (5 min)
1. **Scott Chamberlain** - introduction and [`taxize`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize), [`taxizedb`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxizedb), [`rgbif`](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif), [`spocc`](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc) (10 min)
1. **Zachary Foster** - [`taxa`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa) and [`metacoder`](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/metacoder) (10 min)
1. **Margaret Siple** - using `taxize` to get [IUCN](https://www.iucn.org/) statuses for species found via DNA barcoding of seafood samples and compare them among genera (4 min)
1. **Kathryn Turner** - a use case for `taxize` and `rgbif` to get all available occurrence records from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) for a handful of species, and scaling up to several thousand (4 min)
1. **Kari Norman** - learning lessons in building [`taxadb`](https://github.com/cboettig/taxadb), a local database approach for working with taxonomic names (4 min)
1. **Ciera Martinez** - exploring biodiversity data with undergraduate data scientists using `taxize` and database specific tools like [`neotomoa`](https://github.com/ropensci/neotoma), [`paleoDB`](https://github.com/ropensci/paleobioDB), and [`rglobi`](https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi) (4 min)
1. Q & A (20 min)

🎤 See speaker bios below.

#### Tell us about your use cases

We've tried to make it easy for you to tell us about how you have used [our packages](/packages/). Go to the [UseCases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) in our public forum. Starting a "New Topic" opens a template that suggests what to provide, like the name of the rOpenSci tool or resource you used, a link to a post or code snippet, and a few other optional things. We might share your use case during the Call or tweet about it, so be sure to give your twitter handle.

#### Have a question for the speakers?
