For day 3 of project recaps from [this year's unconf](\(https://ropensci.org/tags/unconf18/\)), here is an overview of the next five projects. Stay tuned for the last recap tomorrow. (Full set of project recaps: [recap 1](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/05/unconf_recap_1/), [recap 2](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/06/unconf18_recap_2/), [recap 3](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/07/unconf_recap_3/), [recap 4](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/08/unconf_recap_4/).)

In the spirit of exploration and experimentation at rOpenSci unconferences, these projects are not necessarily finished products or in scope for rOpenSci packages.

Let's dive into today's 5 projects in focus!

## `jobstatus`

**Summary:** `jobstatus` helps keep an eye on how complex and long-running jobs, including jobs running in parallel, are progressing. The maintainers won't have much time to extend and improve the package so they'd love to have help: if you're keen please let them know in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/jobstatus/issues)!

**Team:** [Nick Golding](https://github.com/goldingn), [Mark Padgham](https://github.com/mpadge), [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5).

## `motifator`

**Summary:** `motifator` is a package aiming at generating spatial motifs that replicate the ones seen in real-world data, without including any potentially identifying information. Potential applications include the analysis of the impact of spatial clustering of different levels of vaccination coverage in a model of infectious disease transmission.

**Team:** [Jon Zelner](http://www.jonzelner.net/)

**Github:** https://github.com/ropenscilabs/motifator

## `QcodeR`

**Summary:** `QcodeR` is a lightweight package to conduct *qualitative coding* i.e. analysis of textual qualitative data such as text from interview transcripts and observation notes, in particular via annotating the text with tags.
