[osfr][osfr-gh] provides a (*hopefully*) convenient R interface to the [Open Science Framework][osf] (aka, OSF). The package completed its rOpenSci peer-review earlier this year and has been [available on CRAN][osfr-cran] since February.

Throughout its development and since its release I've had numerous conversations with members of the R community about OSF (and osfr), and through these interactions a couple recurring patterns emerged. First, it seems that many R users have heard of OSF but relatively few have first-hand experience with it. Second, I'm often asked how OSF compares to GitHub and whether it would even be useful for someone who already uses GitHub to manage their research.

In a future post I'll highlight some features of osfr and demo some real world use cases. However, in order to extract any value from the package, you need to be an OSF user. And so, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide a little background about OSF, what it offers, how it differs from GitHub, and where it might fit into your workflow as an R/GitHub user.

### Who developed OSF?

OSF is developed by the [Center for Open Science][cos] (COS), a non-profit tech company located in Charlottesville, VA. Since its inception in 2007 COS has worked to fundamentally change the scientific endeavor by making it more open and reproducible. They are pursuing this goal on so many fronts: developing metrics that assess Journals based on transparency rather than other nebulous concepts, normalizing strategies like pre-registration and registered reports to address bias, performing high-impact metascience studies to empirically estimate the reproducibility of peer-reviewed research, and to develop tools and services that help researchers of all technical backgrounds adopt best practices for reproducibility. Any of these topics could easily fill an entire blog post but our focus here will be on their flagship service, OSF.

Before diving into its features, I want to acknowledge that OSF is pretty multi-faceted, and includes a number of other services outside of its core project management functionality, including things like [pre-print servers][osf-preprint] and a [research registration repository][osf-registry]. Those aspects of OSF fall outside the scope of this post, which I'm limiting to project management features.

### Is OSF like a GitHub for research?

It's not a perfect analogy as the two services differ in important ways that I'll discuss below, but if you're already familiar with GitHub it certainly provides a useful mental model to get a sense of what OSF offers. For example, like GitHub, OSF is a hosted project management service organized around project repositories that can be private, shared with select collaborators, or made publicly accessible. OSF projects also include cloud storage for uploading project files, automatic file versioning, markdown-based wikis for documentation and/or shared task lists, traffic analytics to assess impact and engagement, and they can even be "forked" by other users.

### How are they different?

Ultimately the two services are different because they are designed for different purposes: facilitating software development vs facilitating scientific research. While the line separating these tasks is often blurry (or non-existant), supporting research requires accommodating files of all shapes and sizes, whereas software (generally) comes in one flavor: plain text. Furthermore, GitHub is intended for software developers, an inherently technical userbase, whereas OSF is designed to accomodate users with a much wider range of computational expertise.

One area where the manifestation of these differences can be seen is in how OSF handles file versions. While OSF automatically stores all previous versions of files as new ones are uploaded, it's not a true version control system in the sense of something like git, which intelligently stores only the differences between file versions, making it possible to easily compare versions and automatically detect conflicting changes. On OSF, the latest version of a file is simply the last uploaded version regardless of how or whether its content changed. However, what OSF's versioning feature lacks in power and options, it makes up for in accessibility---another key differentiator. Creating a new version on OSF simply requires dragging and dropping an updated file onto the project's file browser

Version control is one feature common to both GitHub and OSF, but let's look at some of the key features that are unique OSF that are purpose built for managing and disseminating research.

#### Integrations

First and foremost, I want to point out that adopting (or just testing out) OSF does not require upending your current workflows and abandoning services you're already happy with. That's because OSF directly integrates with many popular services through its [add-ons system][osf-addons]. So although OSF provides its own free cloud storage, if you're already using Dropbox, Google Drive, S3, etc, then you can simply add the relevent folder/bucket from that service to your OSF project. And if you're using GitHub/GitLab to manage your source code (good idea), then you can also link the relevant repository. Either way, they all show-up as first-class citizens in your OSF project, right alongside OSF's native cloud storage buckets.

#### Storage

OSF provides a generous amount of cloud storage for projects, limiting only the size of individual files to < 5Gb. This allows you to store all of your project materials on OSF, even large data files. Furthermore, COS takes [data preservation seriously][osf-preservation], guaranteeing that, in the unlikely event that COS ceases to exist, your files will remain accessible for at least another 50 years from the day it closes its doors.

#### Citations

OSF projects are designed to be easily citable. Every OSF project is assigned a conveniently short URL that comprises a globally unique identifier (GUID); for example, the Psychology Reproducibility Project's OSF page is reachable at <https://osf.io/ezcuj>, where `ezcuj` is its GUID. The GUIDs are immutable and permanent, so you can feel confident sharing an OSF URL, or even including it in a publication, knowing that, as long the project exists and is publicly accessible, it won't become yet another tragic dead link. You can also [generate a DOI][osf-doi] for any public project---no third-party service needed. OSF also strives to make it as convenient as possible for others to cite your work by prominently placing a citation widget on every project page that auto-generates citations in any CSL-supported format.

#### Archives

OSF also provides a registration service to create snapshots of a project's current state. From [OSF's docs][osf-registration]:

> A registration is a frozen, time-stamped copy of an OSF project. Registrations cannot be edited or deleted.

This way, if you decide to include an OSF project in a publication to share your materials and/or data, using the registered project's URL ensures the link always points to the exact set of files exactly as they were at the time of publication.


#### Accessibility

Perhaps OSF's greatest super-power is that all of its functionality is available through a user-friendly point and click interface with a relatively shallow learning curve. As mentioned earlier, OSF is designed for a much wider audience of users that aren't necessarily computational and aren't familiar with git, or even the command line. By significantly lowering the barrier to entry, OSF makes it possible for researchers of all technical abilities to improve their research workflows and follow best practices for reproducibility.

### How does this help you?

As an R user, and possibly a GitHub user, chances are you already have efficient workflows in place for common tasks like sharing and versioning files. But even the best workflows are only as efficient as your least compliant collaborator. As much as we'd all love to write our manuscripts in version controlled RMarkdown documents and receive edits from collaborators via pull requests, the reality is, in a world still dominated by email and Microsoft Office, that's rarely a realistic option.

Fortunately, it's in exactly these types of collaborations that OSF really shines, as a compromise between pure VCS/plain-text Nirvana and whatever the opposite of that might be (I'm picturing a swirling vortex of Word documents with novel-length filenames). In my experience, after providing short 10â€“15 minute tutorials, colleagues have been very willing to adopt OSF as a project hub. And if you do run into holdouts, short emails along the lines of

> I posted the latest results on OSF. You can see them here: `https://osf.io/...`.

go a long way towards gently nudging them in the right direction. Generally, I've found that they really appreciate the piece of mind that comes with knowing their data is in a safe place and the convenience of a one-stop-shop for all project-related content. As for me, I appreciate being able to simply `osf_download()` the latest version of a dataset rather than digging through my email---it's almost like having an API for your collaborators :upside_down_face:.
