In the [second post of the series where we obtained data from
eBird](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/21/birds-radolfzell/) we
determined what birds were observed in the county of Constance, and we
complemented this knowledge with some taxonomic and trait information in
[the fourth post of the
series](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/09/04/birds-taxo-traits/). Now,
we could be curious about the occurrence of these birds in *scientific
work*. In this post, we will query the scientific literature and an open
scientific data repository for species names: what have these birds been
studied for? Read on if you want to learn how to use R packages allowing
to do so!

### Getting a list of 50 species from occurrence data

For more details about the following code, refer to the [previous post
of the series](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/21/birds-radolfzell/).
The single difference is our adding a step to keep only data for the
most recent years.

``` r
# polygon for filtering
landkreis_konstanz <- osmdata::getbb("Landkreis Konstanz",
                             format_out = "sf_polygon")
crs <- sf::st_crs(landkreis_konstanz)

# get and filter data
f_out_ebd <- "ebird/ebd_lk_konstanz.txt"

library("magrittr")

ebd <- auk::read_ebd(f_out_ebd) %>%
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
                crs = crs) 

in_indices <- sf::st_within(ebd, landkreis_konstanz)

ebd <- dplyr::filter(ebd, lengths(in_indices) > 0)

ebd <- as.data.frame(ebd)

ebd <- dplyr::filter(ebd, approved, lubridate::year(observation_date) > 2010)
```

For the sake of simplicity, we shall only use the 50 species observed
the most often.

``` r
species <- ebd %>%
  dplyr::count(common_name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(n = 50) %>%
  dplyr::pull(common_name)
```

The species are Carrion Crow, Eurasian Blackbird, Mallard, Eurasian
Coot, Great Tit, Great Crested Grebe, Mute Swan, Great Cormorant,
Eurasian Blue Tit, Gray Heron, Black-headed Gull, Common Chaffinch,
Common Chiffchaff, Tufted Duck, European Starling, White Wagtail,
European Robin, Little Grebe, Common Wood-Pigeon, Red-crested Pochard,
Ruddy Shelduck, Graylag Goose, Red Kite, Common Buzzard, Eurasian
Blackcap, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Eurasian Magpie, Gadwall, Common
Pochard, Eurasian Nuthatch, Green-winged Teal, House Sparrow, Eurasian
Jay, Yellow-legged Gull, Yellowhammer, Eurasian Green Woodpecker, Eared
Grebe, Eurasian Reed Warbler, Barn Swallow, Northern Shoveler, Eurasian
Moorhen, Black Redstart, Great Egret, White Stork, Eurasian Wren,
Long-tailed Tit, Common House-Martin, Eurasian Kestrel, European
Goldfinch and European Greenfinch
[(`glue::glue_collapse(species, sep = ", ", last = " and ")`)](https://twitter.com/LucyStats/status/1031938964796657665?s=19).

### Querying the scientific literature

Just like rOpenSci has a taxonomic toolbelt
([`taxize`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize)) and a species
occurrence data toolbelt ([`spocc`](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc)),
it has a super package for querying the scientific literature:
[`fulltext`](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext)! This package
supports search for “PLOS via the rplos package, Crossref via the
rcrossref package, Entrez via the rentrez package, arXiv via the aRxiv
package, and BMC, Biorxiv, EuroPMC, and Scopus via internal helper
functions”.

We shall use `fulltext` to retrieve the titles and abstracts of
scientific articles mentioning each species, and will use `tidytext` to
compute the most prevalent words in these works.

We first define a function retrieving the titles and abstracts of works
obtained as result when querying one species name.

We use `dplyr::bind_rows` because we want all results for one species at
once, while `fulltext` returns a list of data.frames with one data.frame
by data source.

``` r
.get_papers <- function(species){
  species %>%
    tolower() %>%
    fulltext::ft_search() %>%
    fulltext::ft_get() %>%
    fulltext::ft_collect() %>%
    fulltext::ft_chunks(c("title", "abstract")) %>%
    fulltext::ft_tabularize() %>%
    dplyr::bind_rows()
}

.get_papers(species[1]) %>%
  dplyr::pull(title)
```

    ## [10] "Dietary Compositions and Their Seasonal Shifts in Japanese Resident Birds, Estimated from the Analysis of Volunteer Monitoring Data"

If we were working on a scientific study, we’d add a few more filters,
e.g. having the species mentioned in the abstract, and not only
somewhere in the paper which is probably the way the different
literature search providers define a match. But we’re not, so we can
keep our query quite free! My favourite paper involving the Carrion Crow
is [“Investigating the impact of media on demand for wildlife: A case
study of Harry Potter and the UK trade in
owls”](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182368)
because it’s a fun and important scientific question, and is supported
by open data (by the way you can access CITES trade data (international
trade in endangered species) in R using
[`cites`](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/cites/) and CITES
Speciesplus database using
[`rcites`](https://ibartomeus.github.io/rcites/)).

We then apply this function to all 50 species and keep each article only
once.

``` r
get_papers <- ratelimitr::limit_rate(.get_papers,
                                     rate = ratelimitr::rate(1, 2))

all_papers <- purrr::map_df(species, get_papers)

nrow(all_papers)
```

    ## [1] 522

``` r
all_papers <- unique(all_papers)

nrow(all_papers)
```

    ## [1] 378

Now, we get the most common words from titles and abstracts. For that we
first append the title to the abstract which is a quick hack.

``` r
library("tidytext")
library("rcorpora")

stopwords <- corpora("words/stopwords/en")$stopWords

all_papers %>%
  dplyr::group_by(title, abstract) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(text = paste(title, abstract)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!word %in% stopwords) %>%
  dplyr::count(word, sort = TRUE) -> words
```

So, what are the most common words in these papers?

``` r
head(words, n = 10) 
```

    ##           word   n
    ## 1      species 754
    ## 2        birds 514
    ## 3        virus 270
    ## 4        avian 268
    ## 5         bird 262
    ## 6        study 243
    ## 7     breeding 231
    ## 8         wild 227
    ## 9  populations 217
    ## 10  population 213

Not too surprising, and obviously less entertaining than looking at
individual species’ results. Maybe a wordcloud can give us a better idea
of the wide area of topics of studies involving our 50 most frequent
bird species. We use the [`wordcloud`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud/index.html).

``` r
library("wordcloud")

with(words, wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 100))
```

![wordcloud of titles and abstracts of scientific
papers](/img/blog-images/2018-09-11-birds-science/wordcloud-1.png)

We see that topics include ecological words such as “foraging” but also
epidemiological questions since “influenza” and “h5n1” come up. Now, how
informative as this wordcloud can be, it’s a bit ugly, so we’ll prettify
it using the [`wordcloud2`
package](https://github.com/Lchiffon/wordcloud2) instead, and the
silhouette of a bird [from
Phylopic](http://phylopic.org/image/6209c9be-060e-4d7f-bc74-a75f3ccf4629/).

``` r
bird <- words %>%
  head(n = 100) %>%
  wordcloud2::wordcloud2(figPath = "bird.png", 
                       color = "black", size = 1.5)
# https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/196-the-wordcloud2-library/
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(bird,
                        "tmp.html",
                        selfcontained = F)
```

I wasn’t able to `webshot` the resulting html despite increasing the
`delay` parameter so I screenshot it by hand!

``` r
magick::image_read("screenshot.png")
```

<img src="/img/blog-images/2018-09-11-birds-science/wordcloud2-1.png" alt="wordcloud shaped as a bird" width="1366" />
<p class="caption">
wordcloud shaped as a bird
</p>

The result is a bit kitsch, doesn’t include the word “species”, one
needs to know it’s the silhouette of a bird to recognize it, and we’d
need to work a bit on not reshaping the silhouette, but it’s fun as it
is.

### Querying scientific open data

There are quite a few scientific open data repositories out there, among
which the giant [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) that has an API
interfaced with an R package. We shall use it to perform a search
similar to the previous section, but looking at the data indexed on
DataONE. Since DataONE specializes in ecological and environmental data,
we expect to find rather ecological data.

We first define a function to retrieve metadata of datasets for one
species. It looks the species names in the abstract.

``` r
.get_meta <- function(species){
  
  cn <- dataone::CNode("PROD")
  search <- list(q = glue::glue("abstract:{species}"),
                        fl = "id,title,abstract",
                        sort = "dateUploaded+desc")
  
  result <- dataone::query(cn, solrQuery = search,
                           as="data.frame")
  
  if(nrow(result) == 0){
    NULL
  }else{
    # otherwise one line by version
  result <- unique(result)
  
  tibble::tibble(species = species,
                 title = result$title,
                 abstract = result$abstract)
  }
}
```

Note that DataONE searching could be more precise: one can choose to
search from a given data source only for instance. See the [searching
DataONE
vignette](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone/blob/master/vignettes/searching-dataone.Rmd).

``` r
get_meta <- ratelimitr::limit_rate(.get_meta,
                                     rate = ratelimitr::rate(1, 2))

all_meta <- purrr::map_df(species, get_meta)

nrow(all_meta)
```

    ## [1] 266

``` r
length(unique(all_meta$species))
```

    ## [1] 35

35 species are represented.

``` r
all_meta <- unique(all_meta[,c("title", "abstract")])

nrow(all_meta)
```

    ## [1] 104

We then extract the most common words.

``` r
all_meta %>%
  dplyr::group_by(title, abstract) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(text = paste(title, abstract)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!word %in% stopwords) %>%
  dplyr::count(word, sort = TRUE) -> data_words

head(data_words, n = 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 2
    ##    word           n
    ##    <chr>      <int>
    ##  1 data         153
    ##  2 species      120
    ##  3 birds         94
    ##  4 breeding      87
    ##  5 feeding       75
    ##  6 population    65
    ##  7 bird          60
    ##  8 genetic       58
    ##  9 study         56
    ## 10 effects       54

Data is the most common word which is quite logical for metadata of
actual datasets. Let’s also have a look at a regular wordcloud.

``` r
with(data_words, wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 100))
```

![wordcloud of titles and abstracts of scientific
metadata](/img/blog-images/2018-09-11-birds-science/wordcloud3-1.png)

As expected, the words seem more focused on ecology than when looking at
scientific papers. DataONE is a gigantic data catalogue, where one could

-   study the results of such queries (e.g. meta studies of number of,
    say, versions by datasets)

-   or find data to integrate to a new study. If you want to *download*
    data from DataONE, refer to the [download data
    vignette](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone/blob/master/vignettes/download-data.Rmd).

### Conclusion

In this post, we used the rOpenSci `fulltext` package, and the DataONE
`dataone` package, to search for bird species names in scientific papers
and scientific open datasets. We were able to draw wordclouds
representing the diversity of topics of studies in which the birds had
been mentioned or studied. Such a search could be fun to do for your
favourite bird(s)! And in general, following the same approach you could
answer your own specific research question.

#### Scientific literature access

As a reminder, the pipeline to retrieve abstracts and titles of works
mentioning a bird species was quite smooth:

``` r
species %>%
    tolower() %>%
    fulltext::ft_search() %>%
    fulltext::ft_get() %>%
    fulltext::ft_collect() %>%
    fulltext::ft_chunks(c("title", "abstract")) %>%
    fulltext::ft_tabularize() %>%
    dplyr::bind_rows()
```

`fulltext` gives you a lot of power! Other rOpenSci accessing literature
data include [`europepmc`](https://github.com/ropensci/europepmc), R
Interface to Europe PMC RESTful Web Service;
[`jstor`](https://github.com/ropensci/jstor);
[`suppdata`](https://github.com/ropensci/suppdata) for extracting
supplemental information, and [much
more](https://ropensci.org/packages/).

#### Scientific data access… and publication with R

In this post we used the [`dataone`
package](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone) to access data from
DataONE. That same package allows uploading data to DataONE. The
rOpenSci suite features the
[`rfigshare`](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare) package for getting
data from, and publishing data to, [Figshare](https://figshare.com/).
For preparing your own data and its documentation for publication, check
out the [`EML` package](https://github.com/ropensci/EML) for writing
metadata respecting the Ecological Metadata Standard, and the [unconf
`dataspice` project](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dataspice) for
simpler metadata entry.
