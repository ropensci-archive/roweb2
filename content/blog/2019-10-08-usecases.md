We want to know how **you** use [rOpenSci packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/) and resources so we can give them, their developers, and your examples more visibility.

It’s valuable to both users and developers of a package to see how it has been used “in the wild”. This goes a long way to encouraging people to keep up development knowing there are others who appreciate and build on their work. This helps people imagine how they might use a package to address their research question, and might provide some code for them to re-use.

As of September 2019, there are 53 use cases in the forum, covering > 30 packages. YY% of these are contributed by community members. Three examples here. These complement the > 800 citations of our tools in the literature. (Scott can I link to [citations](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ropensci_citations/blob/master/citations.tsv)?

### What's your use case?
If your use case is published on the web somewhere, please share it in the [Use Cases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) of our discussion forum. This is the template we added there to guide you.

- Maybe you used [tesseract](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract) to extract text from an image of a historical document

- Maybe you wrote a blog post about the time you used XX to do YY.

- Maybe you published a paper in which you cited your use of an rOpenSci package (add specfic example here).

**Package or resource used**
_This could be for one of our [packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/), our [package development guide book](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/), a [Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/), or a [blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/)_

**URL or code snippet for your use case**
_Link to a blog post, a gist, or an academic paper, or provide some code inline_

**Image**
_This could be a figure from a blog post or paper if you have permission to share it_

**Sector**
_List one of: academic / industry / government / non-profit / other_

**Field(s) of application**
_Examples: ecology, epidemiology, Antarctic and Southern Ocean research, biomedical research, energy, finance, history, social sciences, anything!_

**What did you do?**
_Explain very briefly what you did, to pique your readers' interest_

**Comments**
_Example: feedback or feature request_

**Twitter handle**
_if you would like to be tagged in a tweet about your work_


### No example is trivial!
When you post your use case in the forum we'll tweet from @rOpenSci (and tag you if you shared your twitter handle) and we may include yours, with attribution in our [biweekly newsletter](https://news.ropensci.org/).
