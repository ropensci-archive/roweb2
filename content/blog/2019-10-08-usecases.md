We want to know how **you** use [rOpenSci packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/) and resources so we can give them, their developers, and your examples more visibility.

It’s valuable to both users and developers of a package to see how it has been used “in the wild”. This goes a long way to encouraging people to keep up development knowing there are others who appreciate and build on their work. This helps people imagine how they might use a package to address their research question, and might provide some code for them to re-use.

We have a dedicated [Use Cases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) in our public discussion forum. As of September 2019, there are > 50 use cases, covering > 30 packages. More than half of these have been added by community members. These complement the > 800 citations of our tools in published works.

### Examples

1. **visdat, skimr, assertr, Exploring and understanding a new data set**. [Sharla Gelfand](https://sharla.party/) shared her code, slide deck, and an explanatory blog post. She used the visdat, skimr and assertr packages to demonstrate how she approached a data set on public transit delays [[**Use case**]](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/visdat-skimr-and-assertr-use-case-exploring-and-understanding-a-new-data-set/1620).

1. **nasapower, rnaturalearth, Can rainfall be a useful predictor of epidemic risk across temporal and spatial scales?**. Emerson Del Ponte used to download rainfall data for specific time periods matching the pre- and early-season of period of soybean growth in Brazil. Adam Sparks shared the code he used to create the data/maps for Emerson’s presentation.

1. **rcrossref, crevents**. [[**Use case**]](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/get-tweet-status-id-from-crossref-event-data-with-crevents/1665). [[**Use case**]](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/rcrossref-use-case-leaving-the-house-where-preprints-go/1309). [[**Use case**]](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/rcrossref-for-tidytuesday/1711).

1. **rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review**. [Tiffany Timbers](https://ropensci.org/authors/tiffany-timbers/), her teaching assistants, and students used our guide in both teaching and evaluation in their Collaborative Software Development course in the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science program [[**Use case**]](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/teaching-how-to-create-high-quality-r-packages/1793). [Hao Ye](https://ropensci.org/authors/hao-ye/) used the guide in his review of a manuscript that included an R package [[**Use case**]](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/use-of-r-package-review-guidelines-in-independent-manuscript-review/1795).

Browse the [use cases](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) for applications in academia, industry, government, or "just for fun" with examples on biodiversity, ecology, text, bibliometrics, preprints, workflows and reproducibility, weather, public health, bicycle networks, agronomy, epidemiology, surveys, tweets about fires, seafood mislabelling, and others!

### What's your use case?
If your use case is published on the web somewhere, please [share it](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases). Here's the template we created to guide you.

{{< figure  src = "/img/blog-images/2019-10-08-usecases/usecases-template-shadow.png" width = "600" alt = "screenshot of use cases template with list of fields. List can be found by opening new topic at https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases" >}}

When you post your use case in the forum we'll tweet about it from [@rOpenSci](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci) and we might feature it, with attribution, in our [biweekly newsletter](https://news.ropensci.org/).

Developers and users will thank you!
