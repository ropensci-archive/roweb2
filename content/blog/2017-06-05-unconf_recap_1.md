Following up on Stefanie's recap of [unconf 17](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017), we are following up this entire week with summaries of projects developed at the event. We plan to highlight 4-5 projects each day, with detailed posts from a handful of teams to follow.


## `skimr`
**Summary:**  `skimr`, a package inspired by Hadley Wickham's [precis package](https://github.com/hadley/precis), aims to provide summary statistics iteratively and interactively as part of a pipeline. The package provides easily skimmable summary statistics to help you better understand your data and see what is missing.

## `emldown`

**Summary:** `emldown` is a package for creating a helpful website based on EML metadata. Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a metadata specification developed by the ecology discipline and for the ecology discipline. EML is implemented as a series of XML document types that can by used in a modular and extensible manner to document ecological data.

**Team:** MaÃ«lle Salmon, Kara Woo, Andrew McDonald, Carl Boettiger

## `testrmd`

**Summary:**  `testrmd` provides facilities to enable testing of and reporting on tested R Markdown chunks. When running R Markdown documents as part of a workflow where the data are likely to change with each render, `testrmd` ensures that each chunk will alert the reader to any problems that may arise as a result of such subtle changes in data.

## `webrockets`
