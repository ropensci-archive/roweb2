### Table of resources

The table below uses JS libraries including DataTable and jQuery.
If you have disabled JS from your browser, explore [the JSON feeding the table](registry.json).
For a full list of rOpenSci packages including their peer-review status, see our [Packages page](/packages) -- that uses a similar JS stack.

You can expand rows by clicking on the book emoji :closed_book:.
This will reveal a longer description of the package, as well as a list of scientific papers citing the packages, with their DOI link presented via a link emoji :link:.
Click on the book emoji :book: again to collapse the row.
