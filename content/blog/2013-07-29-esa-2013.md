It's the last week in July and this means that ecologists across North America (and elsewhere) are busy returning from the field and  preparing their presentations and posters in anticipation of the <a href="http://www.esa.org/esa/?page_id=127">annual Ecological Society of America meeting</a>. The entire <a href="http://ropensci.org/about/#devteam">rOpenSci dev team</a> will be in attendance <a href="http://www.esa.org/minneapolis/">this year</a> and we have several workshops, talks, and events planned out. The topics range from half-day workshops on open data, data visualization, reproducible research, to an entire symposium on open science.

Here's a current schedule:
