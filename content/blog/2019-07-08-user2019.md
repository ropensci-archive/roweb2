Three members of the rOpenSci team - Scott Chamberlain, Jenny Bryan, and Rich FitzJohn - as well as many community members will give talks at [useR!2019](http://www.user2019.fr/). Many other package authors, maintainers, reviewers and unconf participants will be there too. Don't hesitate to ask them about rOpenSci [packages](/packages/), [software peer review](/software-review/), [community](/community/), or just say hello if you're looking for a friendly face.

We've listed their talks for you. Search the [schedule](https://connect.rstudioservices.com/content/331/user2019-schedule.html) for details.
