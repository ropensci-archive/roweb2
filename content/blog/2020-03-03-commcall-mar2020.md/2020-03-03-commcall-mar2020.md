Package development often seems like the end goal, but ongoing maintenance is
crucial in keeping a package alive and useful. Packages maintained by a single
developer risk being lost as the developer's situation and priorities change. In
the interest of software sustainability, ideally each package would have more
than one maintainer, but this is relatively rare. Join this community call to
hear more about package maintenance through tips and tricks, best practices for
encouraging contributions, and trials and tribulations of taking over
maintenance of existing packages.

This 1-hour Call will include a panel of four speakers and a moderator Q & A.

_*Elin Waring is* a Professor of Sociology and Interim Dean of the School of Health Sciences, Human Services and Nursing at Lehman College, CUNY. She teaches research methods and statistics. Elin was part of the unconf17 group that developed the skimr package. skimr has become very popular (257k downloads) and Elin works with Michael Quinn to maintain skimr as they have shepherded it through two major releases.  She formerly was a contributor and maintainer for the Joomla! CMS project, and her approach to maintaining is influenced by that. This includes understanding the importance of having a clear concept of what you are trying to achieve, being able to politely but firmly say no and knowing having users changes everything.
