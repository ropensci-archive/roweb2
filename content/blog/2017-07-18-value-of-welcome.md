I’m participating in the <a href="https://www.cscce.org/cefp/" target="_blank">AAAS Community Engagement Fellows Program (CEFP)</a>, funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The inaugural <a href="https://www.cscce.org/2016/12/05/introducing-the-2017-community-engagement-fellows/" target="_blank">cohort of Fellows</a> is made up of 17 community managers working in a wide range of scientific communities. This is cross-posted from the <a href="https://www.cscce.org/2017/07/13/the-value-of-welcome/"target="_blank">Trellis blog</a> as part of a <a href="https://www.cscce.org/tag/fellows-blog-series" target="_blank"> series of reflections</a> that the CEFP Fellows are sharing.

In my training as a [AAAS Community Engagement Fellow](https://www.cscce.org/2016/12/05/introducing-the-2017-community-engagement-fellows/), I hear repeatedly about the value of extending a personal welcome to your community members. This seems intuitive, but recently I put this to the test. Let me tell you about my experience creating and maintaining a #welcome channel in a community Slack group.

I listen in on and occasionally participate in a Slack group for [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) community organizers (R-Ladies is a global organization with local meetup chapters around the world, for women who do/want to do programming in R). Their Slack is incredibly well-organized and has a #welcome channel where new joiners are invited to introduce themselves in a couple of sentences. The leaders regularly jump in to add a wave emoji and ask people to introduce themselves if they have not already.

At rOpenSci, where I am the Community Manager, when people joined our 150+ person Slack group, they used to land in the #general channel where people ask and answer questions. Often, new people joining went unnoticed among the conversations. So recently I copied R-Ladies and created a #welcome channel in our Slack and made sure any new people got dropped in there, as well as in the #general channel. The channel purpose is set as "*A place to welcome new people and for new people to introduce themselves. We welcome participation and civil conversations that adhere to our [code of conduct](https://unconf17.ropensci.org/coc).*"

I pinged three new rOpenSci community members to join and introduce themselves, and in the #general channel said “Hey, come say hi to people over here at #welcome!”. One day later, we already had 33 people in #welcome. I spent that morning nurturing it, noting some people’s activities and contributions that they might not otherwise highlight themselves *e.g.* [Bea](https://twitter.com/Chucheria) just did her first open peer software review for rOpenSci, or [Matt](https://twitter.com/metamattj) has been answering people’s questions about meta data, or [Julie](https://twitter.com/juliesquid), [Ben](https://twitter.com/ben_d_best) and [Jamie](https://twitter.com/jafflerbach) are co-authors on this [cool new paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0160) about open data science tools. And I gave a shoutout to R-Ladies stating clearly that I copied their fantastic #welcome channel.

People are introducing themselves, tagging with emoji and thanking “the community” saying things like:

>“…I feel super lucky to be a part of the rOpenSci community, which has … had a great positive impact on my life!”

>“I love rOpenSci for building this community and helping people like me become confident data scientists!”

>“[I’m] hoping to contribute more to the group moving forward”

>“…thank you for having me part of this community!”


Such is the value of #welcome.
