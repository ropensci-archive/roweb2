The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted all of our lives in a very short period of time. Spring and summer are usually very busy as students prepare to go the field to engage in various data collection efforts. The pandemic has also disrupted these carefully planned activities as travel is suspended and local and remote field stations have closed indefinitely. A lost field season can be a major setback for a dissertation timeline and students will have to improvise. One promising opportunity to continue research efforts during these unprecedented times is taking advantage of the massive amounts of open scientific data that are freely available. Open data can form the basis of a review, synthesis, or new research.

Our goal is to inspire students to find research opportunities with open data and highlight some of the rOpenSci packages that already make programmatic access possible. We also highlight some examples of how specific collections of packages are being used right now in fields such as archaeology and climate.



### Exploring open data

Data are fundamental to scientific discovery and leveraging new discoveries would not be possible without access to data (cite Tierney/Ram). Although people rarely develop new research entirely on open data, these datasets provide an opportunity to reproduce and validate existing results, improve models, and be combined with other data to generate new syntheses. The open science movement has been growing for over a decade and all of that interest has surfaced numerous databases and repositories. The growing interest in reproducibility has also led to the creation of a plethora of open source software to access such data. rOpenSci's core mission is to develop such tools and to date we have built over 120 robust data-access packages.  

We hope that this post and list of tools provides inspiration for you to explore new data sources and chapter ideas. Many of rOpenSci's tools are developed by practicing scientists and have strong communities behind them. 


### Data sources for your research

We've invited a few university faculty and researchers to highlight some sources of open data for research in their fields. 

#### Water

_Louise Slater, University of Oxford, Sam Zipper, University of Kansas, Ilaria Prosdocimi, Ca 'Foscari University, Sam Albers, Government of British Columbia, and Claudia Vitolo, European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts_ 

In hydrology, there has been a rapid growth in the number of streamflow data archives made publicly available online by countries such as the UK, USA, Greece, and Canada (although most countries sadly do not yet apply an open policy to their hydrological data). The [Task View on Hydrological Data and Modelling][] and accompanying blog post [Getting your toes wet in R: Hydrology, meteorology, and more][] provide an exciting overview of the most up-to-date R packages that are available for downloading, analysing, and modelling these data. For an overview of the many advantages of using R for hydrological research, see the paper “Using R in Hydrology” [^1]. 

#### Transport

_Robin Lovelace, University of Leeds_

There has never been a better time for data driven and reproducible transport research. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted transport patterns worldwide and is leading to major changes that would have impossible just months ago, as outlined in a recent news article titled "World cities turn their streets over to walkers and cyclists". 
There is a wealth of data out there that can be found with careful search queries and many new datasets (like [Uber's micromobility datasets][], released on May 6th) but my starter 5 would be:

- For downloading data representing transport networks, I recommend heading to the [overpass website][] and for R users checking out [osmdata][] and the in-development geofabric (to be renamed) R packages.

- For open origin-destination data there are many resources but the PCT package provides a way to access national-scale datasets quickly from the R command line, as outlined stplanr's [Origin-destination vignette][].

- For road safety data there is a lack of open data in many countries but you can access national road casualty data, with 60+ variables and 100,000+ records each year with the [stats19][] package.

- For links to additional resources I recommend Chapter [12][] of Geocomputation with R and Chapter [11][] on QGIS for tansport researchers

- For inspiration, I recommend checking out the Propensity to Cycle Tool, an interactive free and open web app that is being used to inform active transport investment plans in dozens of cities across the UK (it also has many data download options at zone, route and route network levels): https://www.pct.bike/

#### Antarctic and Southern Ocean

_Ben Raymond, Australian Antarctic Division and Anton Van de Putte, KU Leuven_

Antarctic science has a strong culture of open data - the Antarctic treaty itself states that scientific observations and results from Antarctica should be openly shared, and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research has had an active data management group since the late 1980s. To find Antarctic and Southern Ocean data, search the [Antarctic master directory (metadata catalogue)][] or portals such as [biodiversity.aq][] or the [Southern Ocean Observing System][].

#### Climate and Weather

_Brooke Anderson_

Research on weather and climate—and their impacts on humans and the environment—can draw on numerous excellent open data sources, including many made available through programmatic access to data collected and shared by institutions and monitoring networks. The US Geological Survey offers a particular exciting example, offering not only APIs for accessing their data, but also a full suite of R packages developed and shared through the [USGS-R community][]. rOpenSci’s own `rnoaa` package provides access to data through a number of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s open data APIs, allowing for fast and convenient access from R to national or worldwide data on, among others, meteorological observations, sea ice, and tides and currents, while its `bomrang` package offers similar access to data from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology. Other rOpenSci packages provide access to weather- and climate-related data from the Iowa Environment Mesonet (`riem`), New Zealand’s National Climate Database (clifro), the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) dataset (`nasapower`), the US National Centers for Environmental Information’s Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) dataset (GSODR), the US National Hurricane Center (`rrricanes`), the Flanders Environment Agency and Flanders Hydraulics Research’s waterinfo.be dataset (`wateRinfo`), and  Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) (`weathercan`).


#### Archaeology

_Ben Marwick, University of Washington_

Research shuddered to a stop in the Geoarchaeology Lab in early March, with UW being one of the first US campuses to switch to remote work. No longer able to go to campus, we turned our attention to more closely study some of the recent publications that have inspired us. Many of our favourite archaeologists openly archive their research datasets on the Open Science Framework data repository, and we have enjoyed using rOpenSci's `osfr` package to quickly and reproducibly access these materials for in-depth exploration. This enabled us to obtain data rapidly, giving us more time for exploring and testing hypotheses, and ensuring our students could get to the end of the term ready to share some really interesting results.

*More data-oriented stuff from Ben M in case we want different focus from above*

- Good data sources specific to archaeology include tdar.org and opencontext.org.

- There is an R pkg for `tdar` here https://github.com/bocinsky/tdar/ but the number of people using both R and `tdar` is probably in the single digits (hence the abandoned repo here: https://github.com/ropensci/rtdar) 

- Most archaeologists are using generic repositories such as Zenodo, Open Science Framework, Dataverse, etc., because these are free to deposit and the specific archaeology ones are not. 

- I have been using the c14bazAAR package to work with the Australian dataset, if that's useful to know?


#### Ecology

### A lot of data

<!-- Below we'll cover a variety of research areas (see _Thematic Areas_),  -->

_(do we convert this section to a preface to the table stating estimate of total amount of data accessed by all rOpenSci packages? 1-2 sentences to note some impt thematic areas not addressed by experts above, but not noting the packages since they're in the table?)_

rOpenSci packages give R users access to a whole lot of data. 
For illustrative purposes, here are a few of the packages we have covering a variety of different thematic areas:

### This is where you come in

**Are you an academic** - advisor or advisee - who has used one or more of these data sources in your research?
We want others to imagine what's possible by seeing success stories.
Comment on this post to share your story and cite your paper if the work is published.

_(clearly frame the niche - what kinds of examples do we NOT want? open data use as a chapter that's part of a lab or field research thesis?)_ 

**Need help?**
You can find examples of how rOpenSci tools have been used in our [discussion forum use cases category][]. 

Ask questions in our [discussion forum packages category][]. 

_(Stef and Scott to clarify use of questions vs packages categories)_

**What’s missing?** Is there a data source you need to access programmatically but there’s no R package to do that? 
We want to build robust tools for things people actually need. Add your request to our wishlist. 

_(need to have wishlist ready for this. Stef to follow up)_

<!-- **Do you maintain one of these tools?** 
Comment on this post to share more insights, point to tutorials or blog posts, or let them know how they can reach out for advise or feedback. -->

**Are you developing an R package to access an open data source** and you’d like people to know about it?
Post to our [discussion forum packages category][].
Consider submitting the package for [software peer review][].
