Part of rOpenSci's mission is to create technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted R software tools that lower barriers to working with data sources on the web. Our open peer software review system for community-contributed tools is a key component of this. As the rOpenSci community grows and more package authors submit their work for peer review, we need to expand our editorial board to maintain a speedy process. As our [recent post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/05/03/onboarding-is-work/#work-done-by-editors) shows, package submissions have grown every year since we started this experiment, and we see no reason they will slow down!

Editors manage the review process, performing initial package checks, identifying reviewers, and moderating the process until the package is accepted by reviewers and transferred to rOpenSci. Anna Krystalli and Lincoln Mullen have both served as guest editors for rOpenSci. As a Research Software Engineer for University of Sheffield RSE, Anna brings the experience of working at the intersection of science and software development that we need. Lincoln has worked broadly in reproducibility for the digital humanities, and led editorial for specialized text analysis packages on an ad-hoc basis. Anna and Lincoln join as full members of the [editorial board](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding#editors) with Scott Chamberlain, Karthik Ram, Noam Ross and MaÃ«lle Salmon.

**Anna Krystalli** is a Research Software Engineer at [University of Sheffield](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/) with a PhD in marine macroecology. She has helped organize [Reprohacks](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/opencon_london/) where teams try to reproduce papers nominated by their authors from supplied code and data, and is one of Mozilla Foundation's "50 People Who Made the Internet a Better Place in 2016". Anna reviewed the [`codemetar`](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/130) and [`rdflib`](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/169) packages for rOpenSci. During her second package review, Anna started work on an experimental reviewing workflow package, [`pkgreviewr`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkgreviewr).

**Lincoln Mullen** is an Assistant Professor at [George Mason University](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/) with a PhD in history. He is a historian of American religious history and the nineteenth-century United States, with expertise in computational methods for texts and maps. Lincoln maintains three rOpenSci packages [`tokenizers`](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers) for fast, consistent tokenization of natural language text, [`textreuse`](https://github.com/ropensci/textreuse) for detecting text reuse and document similarity, and [`USAboundaries`](https://github.com/ropensci/USAboundaries) for historical and contemporary state, county, and Congressional district boundaries, as well as zip code tabulation area centroids.
