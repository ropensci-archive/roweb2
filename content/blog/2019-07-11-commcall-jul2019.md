Our 1-hour Call on Reproducible Research with R will include three speakers and 20 minutes for Q & A.

[**Ben Marwick**](/authors/ben-marwick/) will introduce you to a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/), which accompanies, enhances, or is a scientific publication providing data, code, and documentation for reproducing a scientific workflow.

From [**Karthik Ram**](/authors/karthik-ram/) you will learn about [holepunch](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/), an R package that will take any GitHub repo with R scripts and R markdown files and quickly turn it in into a free, live RStudio server where anyone can run your code!

[**Anna Krystalli**](/authors/anna-krystalli/) will talk about the [ReproHack](https://sheffield-university.shinyapps.io/ReproHack_CCMcr/) series of one day reproducibility hackathons where participants try to reproduce papers from published code and data. Find out more about what goes on during the events, some early findings, future directions and how you can get involved!
