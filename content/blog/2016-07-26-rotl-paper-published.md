We are excited to announce a paper describing `rotl`, our package for the
[Open Tree of Life](http://www.opentreeoflife.org/) data, has been
[published](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12593). The full
citation is:

Michonneau, F., Brown, J. W. and Winter, D. J. (2016), rotl: an R
package to interact with the Open Tree of Life data. *Methods Ecol
Evol.* doi: <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12593>

The paper, which is freely available, describes the package and the data
it wraps in detail. Rather than rehash the information here, we will use
this post to briefly introduce the goals of the package and thank some
of the people that helped it come to be.

### What data does Open Tree have and how can `rotl` help you get it?

The [Open Tree of Life](http://www.opentreeoflife.org/) combines
knowledge from thousands of scientific studies to produce a single
source of information about the relationships among all species on
earth. In addition to storing the trees and taxonomies that go into this
project, the Open Tree provides a "synthesis tree" that represents this
combined knowledge. The Open Tree data can be accessed via the web page
linked above, and through an API.`rotl` takes advantage of this API to
give R users the ability to search for phylogenetic information and
import the results into their R sessions. The imported data can then be
used with the growing ecosystem of packages for phylogenetic and
comparative biology in R.

### A small example

Using `rotl` to get a tree for a set of names is usually a two step
process. You need to start by matching the set of names you have to
records in the Open Tree database, and obtain unique IDs for each one.
The function `tnrs_match_names` handles this task:

    library(rotl)
    apes <- c("Pongo", "Pan", "Gorilla", "Hoolock", "Homo")
    resolved_names <- tnrs_match_names(apes)
    resolved_names

    ##   search_string unique_name approximate_match ott_id is_synonym flags
    ## 1         pongo       Pongo             FALSE 417949      FALSE
    ## 2           pan         Pan             FALSE 417957      FALSE
    ## 3       gorilla     Gorilla             FALSE 417969      FALSE
    ## 4       hoolock     Hoolock             FALSE 712902      FALSE
    ## 5          homo        Homo             FALSE 770309      FALSE
    ##   number_matches
    ## 1              1
    ## 2              1
    ## 3              1
    ## 4              1
    ## 5              1

Once you have a good set of unique IDs, you will want to fetch a tree.
You can use `ott_id` to extract just the IDs from the table returned by
`tnrs_match_names` and pass those to `tol_induced_subtree` to fetch a
tree with theses species in the tips

    tr <- tol_induced_subtree(ott_ids=ott_id(resolved_names))
    plot(tr)

The tree is an object of the `ape` class `phylo`, which is used by most
other phylogeny packages in R. There are two vignettes describing how
the fetched trees can be [paired with other
data](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rotl/vignettes/data_mashups.html)
and used to [reproduce a comparative
analysis](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rotl/vignettes/meta-analysis.html).
[Another
vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rotl/vignettes/how-to-use-rotl.html)
provides and introduction to the package and includes an FAQ.

### Thanks

We'd like to thank the Open Tree project for providing such an amazing
resource, and  for producing a powerful and well-documented API. `rotl` was
initially developed as part of the [Open Tree's hackathon in Ann Arbor
in
2014](https://ropensci.org/blog/2014/08/15/open-tree-of-life-hackathon/).
We'd like to thank the Open Tree project for inviting us to the meeting
and all participants of that meeting for discussions and their feedback
on `rotl`. The package was reviewed as part of the rOpenSci onboarding
process, and we'd like to thank [Scott
Chamberlain](http://scottchamberlain.info/) for the time and expertise
that went into this review and improved the package.
