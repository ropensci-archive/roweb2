After Stefanie's recap of [unconf18](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2018/06/05/unconf18), this week the blog will feature brief summaries of projects developed at the event: each day 4 to 5 projects will be highlighted. (Full set of project recaps: [recap 1](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/05/unconf_recap_1/), [recap 2](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/06/unconf18_recap_2/), [recap 3](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/07/unconf_recap_3/), [recap 4](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/08/unconf_recap_4/)) In the following weeks, a handful of groups will share more thorough posts about their work.

In the spirit of exploration and experimentation at rOpenSci unconferences, these projects are not necessarily finished products or in scope for rOpenSci packages.


Let's dive into today's 5 projects in focus!


### `mchtoolbox`

**Summary:** `mchtoolbox` is a package supporting the computation of commonly used maternal-child health metrics within R in a [tidy](https://www.tidyverse.org/) workflow. It also features a Shiny app allowing use of the functions by less R-savvy users.

**Team:** [Monica W. Gerber](https://github.com/monicagerber), [Charles T. Gray](https://github.com/softloud), [Jennifer Thompson](https://jenthompson.me/), [W. Kyle Hamilton](http://kylehamilton.com/), [Jenny Draper](https://www.esr.cri.nz).

**Github:** https://github.com/ropenscilabs/mchtoolbox


### `pkginspector`

**Summary:** This team worked on writing functionalities aimed at facilitating rOpenSci [onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review) package reviews. The [`pkginspector` package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkginspector) will allow analyzing function calls, argument default usage and dependency usage within a package.

**Summary:** Based on her [.Rprofile interview series](https://ropensci.org/tags/rprofile/) started at unconf17, Kelly O'Briant started interviewing R users about, in her words, a process or package or R-related life skill that they're highly opinionated about, to prepare a new blog post series called .Renviron.

Are you interested in interviewing? Being interviewed? Do you have cool ideas for this project? Get in touch by creating [an issue in her project repo](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rOpenInterviews/issues/new) or reaching out to Kelly on Twitter [@kellrstats](https://twitter.com/kellrstats).

**Team:** [Kelly O'Briant](https://kellobri.github.io/).
