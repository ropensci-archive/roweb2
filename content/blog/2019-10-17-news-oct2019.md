### rOpenSci HQ

* What would **you** like to hear about in an rOpenSci Community Call? We are soliciting your "votes" and new ideas for Community Call topics and speakers. Find out how you can influence us by checking out our new [Community Calls repository](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls).
*  Videos, speaker's slides, resources and collaborative notes from our Community Call on [Reproducible Workflows at Scale with drake](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-09-24/) are posted.
* Help wanted! We encourage rOpenSci package authors to help us help you get more contributors to your package. If you label an issue “help wanted” (no hyphen or emojis), those issues can be found in a [search of the rOpenSci organization](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues); and on the rOpenSci GitHub landing page https://github.com/ropensci the number of open help wanted issues is highlighted for each package that has them.
