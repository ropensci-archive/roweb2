The rOpenSci team is growing, thanks in part to our [recent funding](/blog/2015/11/19/helmsley-trust-funding/). We recently [welcomed](/blog/2016/03/01/pdftools-and-jeroen) Jeroen Ooms on the software development side and today we're thrilled to announce a position for community manager.

Our mission is to expand access to scientific data and promote a culture of reproducible research and sustainable research software. We aim to cultivate a vibrant and open community through activities such as our [community calls](http://communitycalls.ropensci.org/), [discussion forums](http://discuss.ropensci.org/), [package review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review), and [annual unconferences](http://unconf16.ropensci.org/). We are ready for a dedicated community manager to come on board to broaden the understanding and reach of rOpenSci to the researcher community.

We're looking for someone who can:

* **Disseminate** updates about our projects and activities to diverse communities via blog posts, Twitter, and related outlets.

* **Engage** with the research community on discussion forums and speak at meetings.
* **Organize** events such as our annual unconferences [locally](http://unconf16.ropensci.org/) and [internationally](http://auunconf.ropensci.org/) (We've got an admin to take care of logistics).

* **Wrangle** our (mostly remote) team and coordinate us, our contractors, and future research fellows.

What we're looking for in our community manager:

* A bachelor's degree in science. Although prior research experience is not necessary, you must have a strong understanding of the culture of science from having worked in that environment.

* Some evidence of community building efforts. A successful blog, an engaging Twitter account, events you've previously organized are the kinds of things we're looking for.

* A passion for open source/science and a hacker mentality. While the position does not involve any software development, you must be comfortable enough to use/learn various tools that are integral to our stack including R packages, Git/GitHub.

The position comes with a competitive salary and benefits and is based at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. Remote work is also an option for the right candidate.

**About Us**
We're a [team of four](/about/#team), with a five person [leadership team](/about/#team), and an [advisory board](/about/#team). We're a grant funded organization based within UC Berkeley. We have [a large community](/community/#community) of contributors, and a much larger community of users. Our tools are focused around the R language, but we promote open science/open source widely.
