Our next Community Call aims to help people recognize the breadth and depth of applications for rOpenSci's R packages to access and analyze taxonomy and biodiversity data, and to learn a bit about using them. We also aim to learn from the discussion how we might improve these tools.

Scott Chamberlain, developer and maintainer of many of these packages will start with an introduction and presentation on our tools like [taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize), [taxizedb](https://github.com/ropensci/taxizedb), [rgbif](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif), [spocc](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc). He'll be followed by Zachary Foster, rOpenSci Fellow, on the [taxa](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa) and [metacoder](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/metacoder) packages. Addressing research questions involves combining multiple tools and data sources. We'll hear about "use cases in the wild" from Margaret Siple and Kathryn Turner. We'll have 20 minutes at the end for Q & A from the audience.

See speaker bios below (ANCHOR).  


üïò weekday, March 27th, 2pm PDT ([find your timezone]  (LINK))

Everyone is welcome. No RSVP needed.

### What packages are we talking about?

The Taxonomy [Task View](https://github.com/ropensci/taxonomy#taxonomy) lists some relevant packages (not exclusive to rOpenSci).

### Tell us about your use cases

We've tried to make it easy for you to tell us about your applications for our taxonomy and biodiversity packages. Start a "New Topic" in the [UseCases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) in our public forum. That opens a template that suggests what information to provide, like name of the rOpenSci tool or resource you used, a link to a post or code snippet for your use case, maybe your twitter handle and a few other optional things. Maybe we'll share yours during the Call.

### Have a question for the speakers?

Add yours to the comments below. See a question you'd like to have answered? Give it a ‚ù§Ô∏è. The moderator may select some of these questions to ask during Q & A.
