Today we are pleased to announce that rOpenSci has been awarded a generous 180K grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan foundation](http://www.sloan.org/). This funding will allow us to develop a whole new suite of tools and provide scientists with general purpose toolkits to access various kinds of scientific data. We will also be traveling a whole bunch this year and running workshops at several conferences and universities. If you'd like us to speak to your research group, please [get in touch](/contact/). We'll be at several events over the coming months including [The Ecological Society of America annual meeting](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/nceas-leads-hands-primer-ecoinformatics-ecological-society-americas-2013-conference), [The Open knowledge conference](http://okcon.org/), Science Online Climate, [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org/Plan-for-a-Meeting/AGUMeetings/) and several others. Stay tuned for announcements on <a href="http://twitter.com/ropensci">Twitter</a>, our [blog](/blog/) ([rss](/feed.xml)) and new mailing list.
