In order to facilitate a transformation towards open and reproducible research, rOpenSci is building and improving not only the technical infrastructure, but the social infrastructure as well. To support this, occasionally a Community Call will focus on a topic that reflects the values of rOpenSci. The first of these, on Thursday, December 15th, 8-9 AM PST, will be on "How do I create a code of conduct for my event/lab/codebase?".

[**Safia Abdalla**](http://safia.rocks/) is a data scientist and software engineer with an interest in open source software and data science for social good. She helps build nteract, a [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/open-source-projects.html) fiscally sponsored open source project, and organizes PyData Chicago. Safia has written about codes of conduct in [How To Create A Welcoming and Inclusive Open Source Space](http://blog.safia.rocks/post/141972488250/how-to-create-a-welcoming-and-inclusive-open).

[**Pauline Barmby**](https://nearby-galaxies.github.io/people/) is an Associate Professor in Physics and Astronomy and Associate Dean of Graduate and Post Doctoral Studies at Western University. Her research focuses on nearby galaxies and [her blog](http://pbarmby.github.io/) contains musings about astrophysics, science teaching, computing, and perhaps knitting, curling, and science fiction. Pauline is the head of Data/Software Carpentry's code of conduct committee and will talk about their experiences in refining their code to ensure it has enforceable consequences.

[**C. Titus Brown**](http://ivory.idyll.org) is an Associate Professor at UC Davis, where his [Lab for Data Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) tackles questions surrounding biological data analysis, data integration, and data sharing. The lab's primary interest is in genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic sequence analysis. Titus has developed a [Lab Code of Conduct](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html)
He recently wrote about [What is open science?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-what-is-open-science.html)
