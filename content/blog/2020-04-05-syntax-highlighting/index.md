This is the R Markdown (.Rmd) template for a blog post or tech note. 
To generate your post with just Markdown (.md), use that template instead.

Throughout this template, including the YAML, 
you should change "post-template" to the slug of your post, 
and "2019-06-04" to your publication date.

Save this file under /content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.Rmd in the local copy of your roweb2 fork.

The chunk below ensures your plots will be inserted in the same folder as your Rmd so you can submit the bundle (.Rmd, .md, images) to roweb2.



One example

```r {linenos=table,hl_lines=[1,"4-6"],linenostart=199}
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
```

Another example

```r {hl_lines=[1,"4-6"]}
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1

a <- 1
```
