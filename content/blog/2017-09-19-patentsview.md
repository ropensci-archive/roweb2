### Why care about patents?

**1. Patents play a critical role in incentivizing innovation, without
which we wouldn't have much of the technology we rely on everyday**

What does your iPhone, Google's PageRank algorithm, and a butter
substitute called Smart Balance all have in common?

...They all probably wouldn't be here if not for patents. A patent
provides its owner with the ability to make money off of something that
they invented, without having to worry about someone else copying their
technology. Think Apple would spend millions of dollars developing the
iPhone if Samsung could just come along and [rip it
off](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-samsung-elec-appeal-idUSKCN1271LF)?
Probably not.

**2. Patents offer a great opportunity for data analysis**

There are two primary reasons for this:

-   **Patent data is public**. In return for the exclusive right to
    profit off an invention, an individual/company has to publicly
    disclose the details of their invention to the rest of the world.
    [Examples of those
    details](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=11&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=dog&OS=dog&RS=dog)
    include the patent's title, abstract, technology classification,
    assigned organizations, etc.
-   **Patent data can answer questions that people care about**.
    Companies (especially big ones like IBM and Google) have a vested
    interest in extracting insights from patents, and spend a lot of
    time/resources trying figure out how to best manage their
    intellectual property (IP) rights. They're plagued by questions like
    "who should I sell my underperforming patents to," "which technology
    areas are open to new innovations," "what's going to be the next big
    thing in the world of buttery spreads," etc. Patents offer a way to
    provide data-driven answers to these questions.

Combined, these two things make patents a prime target for data
analysis. However, until recently it was hard to get at the data inside
these documents. One had to either collect it manually using the
official [United States Patent and Trademark
Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office)
(USPTO) [search
engine](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm), or figure
out a way to download, parse, and model huge XML data dumps. Enter
PatentsView.

### PatentsView and the `patentsview` package


[PatentsView](http://www.patentsview.org/web/#viz/relationships) is one
of USPTO's new initiatives intended to increase the usability and value
of patent data. One feature of this project is a publicly accessible API
that makes it easy to programmatically interact with the data. A few of
the reasons why I like the API (and PatentsView more generally):

-   The API is free (no credential required) and currently doesn't
    impose rate limits/bandwidth throttling.
-   The project offers [bulk downloads of patent
    data](http://www.patentsview.org/download/) on their website (in a
    flat file format), for those who want to be closest to the data.
-   Both the API and the bulk download data contain disambiguated
    entities such as inventors, assignees, organizations, etc. In other
    words, the API will tell you whether it thinks that John Smith on
    patent X is the same person as John Smith on patent Y. [^1]

The `patentsview` R package is a wrapper around the PatentsView API. It
contains a function that acts as a client to the API (`search_pv()`) as
well as several supporting functions. Full documentation of the package
can be found on its
[website](https://ropensci.github.io/patentsview/index.html).

### Installation

You can install the stable version of `patentsview` from CRAN:

    install.packages("patentsview")

Or get the development version from GitHub:

    if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

    devtools::install_github("ropensci/patentsview")

### Getting started

The package has one main function, `search_pv()`, that makes it easy to
send requests to the API. There are two parameters to `search_pv()` that
you're going to want to think about just about every time you call it -
`query` and `fields`. You tell the API how you want to filter the patent
data with `query`, and which fields you want to retrieve with
`fields`. [^2]

#### `query`

Your query has to use the [PatentsView query
language](http://www.patentsview.org/api/query-language.html), which is
a JSON-based syntax that is similar to the one used by Lucene. You can
write the query directly and pass it as a string to `search_pv()`:

    library(patentsview)

    qry_1 <- '{"_gt":{"patent_year":2007}}'
    search_pv(query = qry_1, fields = NULL) # This will retrieve a default set of fields
    #> $data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame on the patent data level:
    #>
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ patents:'data.frame': 25 obs. of  3 variables:
    #>   ..$ patent_id    : chr [1:25] "7313829" ...
    #>   ..$ patent_number: chr [1:25] "7313829" ...
    #>   ..$ patent_title : chr [1:25] "Sealing device for body suit and sealin"..
    #>
    #> $query_results
    #> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
    #>
    #> total_patent_count = 100,000

...Or you can use the domain specific language (DSL) provided in the
`patentsview` package to help you write the query:

    qry_2 <- qry_funs$gt(patent_year = 2007) # All DSL functions are in the qry_funs list
    qry_2 # qry_2 is the same as qry_1
    #> {"_gt":{"patent_year":2007}}

    search_pv(query = qry_2)
    #> $data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame on the patent data level:
    #>
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ patents:'data.frame': 25 obs. of  3 variables:
    #>   ..$ patent_id    : chr [1:25] "7313829" ...
    #>   ..$ patent_number: chr [1:25] "7313829" ...
    #>   ..$ patent_title : chr [1:25] "Sealing device for body suit and sealin"..
    #>
    #> $query_results
    #> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
    #>
    #> total_patent_count = 100,000

`qry_1` and `qry_2` will result in the same HTTP call to the API. Both
queries search for patents in USPTO that were published after 2007.
There are three gotchas to look out for when writing a query:

1.  **Field is queryable.** The API has 7 endpoints (the default
    endpoint is "patents"), and each endpoint has its own set of fields
    that you can filter on. *The fields that you can filter on are not
    necessarily the same as the ones that you can retrieve.* In other
    words, the fields that you can include in `query` (e.g.,
    `patent_year`) are not necessarily the same as those that you can
    include in `fields`. To see which fields you can query on, look in
    the `fieldsdf` data frame (`View(patentsview::fieldsdf)`) for fields
    that have a "y" indicator in their `can_query` column for your given
    endpoint.
2.  **Correct data type for field.** If you're filtering on a field in
    your query, you have to make sure that the value you are filtering
    on is consistent with the field's data type. For example,
    `patent_year` has type "integer," so if you pass 2007 as a string
    then you're going to get an error (`patent_year = 2007` is good,
    `patent_year = "2007"` is no good). You can find a field's data type
    in the `fieldsdf` data frame.
3.  **Comparison function works with field's data type.** The comparison
    function(s) that you use (e.g., the greater-than function shown
    above, `qry_funs$gt()`) must be consistent with the field's data
    type. For example, you can't use the "contains" function on fields
    of type "integer" (`qry_funs$contains(patent_year = 2007)` will
    throw an error). See `?qry_funs` for more details.

In short, use the `fieldsdf` data frame when you write a query and you
should be fine. Check out the [writing queries
vignette](https://ropensci.github.io/patentsview/articles/writing-queries.html)
for more details.

#### `fields`

Up until now we have been using the default value for `fields`. This
results in the API giving us some small set of default fields. Let's see
about retrieving some more fields:

    search_pv(
      query = qry_funs$gt(patent_year = 2007),
      fields = c("patent_abstract", "patent_average_processing_time",
                 "inventor_first_name", "inventor_total_num_patents")
    )
    #> $data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame (with list column(s) inside) on the patent data level:
    #>
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ patents:'data.frame': 25 obs. of  3 variables:
    #>   ..$ patent_abstract               : chr [1:25] "A sealing device for a"..
    #>   ..$ patent_average_processing_time: chr [1:25] "1324" ...
    #>   ..$ inventors                     :List of 25
    #>
    #> $query_results
    #> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
    #>
    #> total_patent_count = 100,000

The fields that you can retrieve depends on the endpoint that you are
hitting. We've been using the "patents" endpoint thus far, so all of
these are retrievable:
`fieldsdf[fieldsdf$endpoint == "patents", "field"]`. You can also use
`get_fields()` to list the retrievable fields for a given endpoint:

    search_pv(
      query = qry_funs$gt(patent_year = 2007),
      fields = get_fields(endpoint = "patents", groups = c("patents", "inventors"))
    )
    #> $data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame (with list column(s) inside) on the patent data level:
    #>
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ patents:'data.frame': 25 obs. of  31 variables:
    #>   ..$ patent_abstract                       : chr [1:25] "A sealing devi"..

### Example

Let's look at a quick example of pulling and analyzing patent data.
We'll look at patents from the last ten years that are classified below
the [H04L63/00 CPC
code](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/classification#!/CPC=H04L63/02).
Patents in this area relate to "network architectures or network
communication protocols for separating internal from external
traffic." [^3] CPC codes offer a quick and dirty way to find patents of
interest, though getting a sense of their hierarchy can be tricky.

1.  Download the data

<!-- -->

    library(patentsview)

    # Write a query:
    query <- with_qfuns( # with_qfuns is basically just: with(qry_funs, ...)
      and(
        begins(cpc_subgroup_id = 'H04L63/02'),
        gte(patent_year = 2007)
      )
    )

    # Create a list of fields:
    fields <- c(
      c("patent_number", "patent_year"),
      get_fields(endpoint = "patents", groups = c("assignees", "cpcs"))
    )

    # Send HTTP request to API's server:
    pv_res <- search_pv(query = query, fields = fields, all_pages = TRUE)

1.  See where the patents are coming from (geographically)

<!-- -->

    library(leaflet)
    library(htmltools)
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)

    data <-
      pv_res$data$patents %>%
        unnest(assignees) %>%
        select(assignee_id, assignee_organization, patent_number,
               assignee_longitude, assignee_latitude) %>%
        group_by_at(vars(-matches("pat"))) %>%
        mutate(num_pats = n()) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        select(-patent_number) %>%
        distinct() %>%
        mutate(popup = paste0("<font color='Black'>",
                              htmlEscape(assignee_organization), "<br><br>Patents:",
                              num_pats, "</font>")) %>%
        mutate_at(vars(matches("_l")), as.numeric) %>%
        filter(!is.na(assignee_id))

    leaflet(data) %>%
      addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatterNoLabels) %>%
      addCircleMarkers(lng = ~assignee_longitude, lat = ~assignee_latitude,
                       popup = ~popup, ~sqrt(num_pats), color = "yellow")

![](/assets/blog-images/2017-09-19-patentsview/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

1.  Plot the growth of the field's topics over time

<!-- -->

    library(ggplot2)
    library(RColorBrewer)

    data <-
      pv_res$data$patents %>%
        unnest(cpcs) %>%
        filter(cpc_subgroup_id != "H04L63/02") %>% # remove patents categorized into only top-level category of H04L63/02
        mutate(
          title = case_when(
            grepl("filtering", .$cpc_subgroup_title, ignore.case = T) ~
              "Filtering policies",
            .$cpc_subgroup_id %in% c("H04L63/0209", "H04L63/0218") ~
              "Architectural arrangements",

              "Firewall traversal",
            TRUE ~
              .$cpc_subgroup_title
          )
        ) %>%
        mutate(title = gsub(".*(?=-)-", "", title, perl = TRUE)) %>%
        group_by(title, patent_year) %>%
        count() %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        mutate(patent_year = as.numeric(patent_year))

    ggplot(data = data) +
      geom_smooth(aes(x = patent_year, y = n, colour = title), se = FALSE) +
      scale_x_continuous("\nPublication year", limits = c(2007, 2016),
                         breaks = 2007:2016) +
      scale_y_continuous("Patents\n", limits = c(0, 700)) +
      scale_colour_manual("", values = brewer.pal(5, "Set2")) +
      theme_bw() + # theme inspired by https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/

### Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank the package's two reviewers, [Paul
Oldham](https://github.com/poldham) and [Verena
Haunschmid](http://blog.haunschmid.name/), for taking the time to review
the package and providing helpful feedback. I'd also like to thank
[Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/) for shepherding the package
along the rOpenSci review process, as well [Scott
Chamberlain](https://scottchamberlain.info/) and [Stefanie
Butland](https://twitter.com/stefaniebutland) for their miscellaneous
help.

[^1]: This is both good and bad, as there are errors in the disambiguation. The algorithm that is responsible for the disambiguation was created by the winner of the [PatentsView Inventor Disambiguation Technical Workshop](http://www.patentsview.org/workshop/).
[^2]: These two parameters end up getting translated into a MySQL query by the API's server, which then gets sent to a back-end database. `query` and `fields` are used to create the query's `WHERE` and `SELECT` clauses, respectively.
[^3]: There is a slightly more in-depth definition that says that these are patents "related to the (logical) separation of traffic/(sub-) networks to achieve protection."
