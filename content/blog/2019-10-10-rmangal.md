In early September, the version 2.0.0 of
[rmangal][rmangal] was approved by rOpenSci and made the CRAN in early October.
Following-up on this great experience, in this blogpost, we expand on the
reasons why we wrote rmangal and detail how the peer-review improve our package.



### Mangal - a data base of published ecological networks

<!-- HERE WHAT IS IN  -->

Ecological networks are set of species population (the nodes of the network)
connected through ecological interactions (the edges). Interactions are
ecological processes in which one species population affects another. Predation is probably the most known kind of interaction, but there are also various non-trophic interactions. For instance, when a mammal unintentionally disperses a seed that somehow landed on its hairs, it is a non-trophic interaction. Within a network interactions of all kind occur simultaneously, making ecological complex and fascinating. When a bird eat a berry and defecate from a bush and defecate the seeds further away, then you have a two way interaction: one trophic a bird eats a berry, one non-trophic a seed has been dispersed.

Ecologists are currently compiling datasets to explore how the structure of
ecological interactions (i.e. how interaction are disturbed in the network) vary
over environmental gradients (e.g. latitudinal gradient). This is a fundamental
research question with a applied perspective as these investigation should help
us understanding how ecological networks will respond to global change. To this
end, the Mangal project <https://mangal.io/#/> led by [Timothée
Poisot](https://poisotlab.io/), [Steve Vissault](https://steveviss.github.io/)
and [Dominique Gravel](https://ielab.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/) standardize
published ecological network and ease their access. For all datasets, Mangal
includes:

- the details of the original publication;
- a description of all networks included in the original publication;

Moreover, for all networks, Mangal includes:

- details about all species of the network, notably several taxonomic identifiers;
- information about the interactions, notably their type.

Currently, Mangal includes 172 datasets, which represents over 1300 ecological networks.



### An R client to make ecological networks easily accessible


In 2016, the first paper describing the project was published[^original_ref] and
introduced a [first version of
rmangal](https://github.com/mangal-wg/rmangal-v1). In 2018, a substantial effort
was put to improve the data structure and the web API has been rewritten and a
new website was launched.

 alt="write an alternative text describing the information contained in the image" width="100%" >}}


Because of all these modifications, the first version of rmangal was obsolete
and a new version needed. It is worth explaining here why the R client is a
important component of the Mangal project. Even though Mangal comes with a
documented [RESTful API](https://mangal.io/doc/api/), this is a technology that
is not commonly used as such by ecologists. On the contrary, R is a very popular
programming langage among ecologists, therefore providing a R client is of major
importance to ensure that the community that built this knowledge can easily use
them, as easily as possible. The same arguments hold true for the [Julia
client](https://mangal.io/doc/jl/) that [Timothée Poisot](https://poisotlab.io/)
wrote as [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is increasingly popular among
theoreticians, that can test theory with such datasets.

The package rmangal allows users to search for ecological networks in a flexible
way and to retrieve ecological networks that are formatted, so that they can
directly analyze them. Moreover, to make rmangal even more powerful, we added
functions to convert Mangal networks into [igraph][igraph] and
[tidygraph][tidygraph] objects. Also, it is really useful to filter ecological
using [sf][sf] and visualize
them with [ggraph][ggraph]. All these aspects are covered in the vignette ["get
started with rmangal"](ttps://ropensci.github.io/rmangal/articles/rmangal.html).






### Package development


<!-- version to prerelease -->
We had two objectifs for [rmangal 2.0.0][rmangal]. The first one was to allow
the users to seacrh for data in a very flexible way. From a technical point this
meant that we had to write functions to query all the endpoints of the [new web
API][API]. The second goal, was to make the package as easy to use as possible.
To do so, we used explicit and consistent names for functions and arguments,
designed a simple workflow, and documented how to use related packages (such as
[igraph][igraph]). Once out two objectifs achieved, we submitted the package to
rOpenSci for peer-review. Basically because we needed feedback, we needed people
to critically assess whether or two objectifs were achieved. Given the string
expertise of rOpenSci in software review, and given that our package was
in-scope, submitting rmangal to rOpenSci was an obvious choice.


We [had very valuable
feedback](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/332) from [Anna
Willoughby][arw36] and [Thomas Lin Pedersen][thomasp85]. They
critically assessed our work and pointed out areas where improvement was
required. One good example of how their review made our package better concerns
the set of dependencies. We originally listed [sf][sf] in `Imports` because we
used it to filter networks based on geographic coordinates. But this was more a
"confort feature" and, as mentioned by the reviewers, [sf][sf] has many
dependencies. So for one more feature, we would have increase a lot the number
of indirect dependencies. Following the reviewers suggestions we moved [sf][sf]
to `Suggests` and warned the user that [this
feature](https://ropensci.github.io/rmangal/articles/rmangal.html#geolocalize-mangal-networks-with-sf)
requires sf when the package is not installed. Similarly, based on the comments,
we added a function to convert Mangal networks to tidygraph object and added
both tidygraph and ggraph to `Suggests`. This consideration may sound like a
detail, but adding a new package to an existing ecosystem of package actually
matters. The plethora of R packages is a major strength of the software, and
connecting your package properly with other related one make the ecosystem of
package working even better.


<!-- Future -->
We are now looking for user feedback not only for rmangal but also for the API
and the website. We welcome suggestions and contribution, especially for the
documentation. In the future, we emvision that rmangal will integrate functions
format ecological networks so that ecologists can add their new dataset to
Mangal. The addition of new entries from anyone would require an evaluation of the data sets submitted.  Based on the success of the software submission
rOpenSci, we could use a similar handle (at a smaller sclae) to the submission of new ecological network.



### Acknowledgments

We would like to thanks [Anna Willoughby][arw36] and [Thomas
Lin Pedersen][thomasp85] for thorough reviews that greatly contribute to improve
rmangal, [Noam Ross](https://github.com/noamross) for handling the review
process. We are also thankful to all [contributors to
rmangal](https://github.com/ropensci/rmangal/graphs/contributors) and to all
ecologists that have spent countless hours in collecting data that Mangal is
compiling.
