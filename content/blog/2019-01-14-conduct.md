We are pleased to announce the release of our [new Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct). rOpenSci's community is our best asset and it's important that we put strong mechanisms in place before we have to act on a report.

As before, our Code applies equally to members of the rOpenSci team and to anyone from the community at large participating in in-person or online activities.

**What's new?**

- A Code of Conduct Committee: Stefanie Butland (rOpenSci Community Manager), Scott Chamberlain (rOpenSci Co-founder and Technical Lead) and Kara Woo (independent community member). We are responsible for receiving, investigating, deciding, enforcing and reporting on all reports of potential violations of our Code.
- Greater detail about acceptable and unacceptable behaviors
- Clear instructions on how to make a report
- Information on how reports will be handled
- A commitment to transparency with our community while upholding the privacy of victims

Our new Code of Conduct has been influenced by and adapted from many sources including the [Open Source and Feelings](https://youtu.be/nizfHxg8y3o) talk by [Audrey Eschright](http://lifeofaudrey.com/), the R Consortium Community Diversity and Inclusion Working Group's draft [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/tree/master/conduct), the [Geek Feminism anti-harassment policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy), our own Community Call, [How do I create a Code of Conduct for my event/lab/codebase?](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/12/21/commcallv12-review-coc/), incident reporting forms from [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) & [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md), and perhaps most importantly, by community members from whom we learn so much.

We welcome your feedback in the comments and we thank you for working with us to keep rOpenSci a safe, enjoyable, friendly, and enriching experience for everyone who participates.
