## `mwparser`

**Summary:**  Wikimarkup is the language used on Wikipedia and similar projects, and as such contains a lot of valuable data both for scientists studying collaborative systems and people studying things documented on or in Wikipedia. mwparser parses wikimarkup, allowing a user to filter down to specific types of tags such as links or templates, and then extract components of those tags.

**Team:** Oliver Keyes

**Github:** [https://github.com/Ironholds/mwparser](https://github.com/Ironholds/mwparser)

## `Gargle`

**Summary:** Gargle is a library that provides authentication for Google APIs but without all the agonizing pain. The package provides helper functions (for `httr`) to support automatic retries, paging, and progress bars for API calls.

**Team:** Craig Citro

**Github:** [https://github.com/r-lib/gargle](https://github.com/r-lib/gargle)

## `arresteddev`

**Summary:** This package is designed to help troubleshoot errors that come up during package and analysis development. As of now, the package helps track tracebacks and errors but more functionality is planned for the future.
