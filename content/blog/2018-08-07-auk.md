[eBird](https://www.ebird.org) is an online tool for recording bird
observations. The eBird database currently contains over 500 million
records of bird sightings, spanning every country and nearly every bird
species, making it an extremely valuable resource for bird research and
conservation. These data can be used to map the distribution and
abundance of species, and assess how species’ ranges are changing over
time. This dataset is available for download as a text file; however,
this file is huge (over 180 GB\!) and, therefore, poses some unique
challenges. In particular, it isn’t possible to import and manipulate
the full dataset in R. Working with these data typically requires
filtering them to a smaller subset of desired observations before
reading into R. This filtering is most efficiently done using AWK, a
Unix utility and programming language for processing column formatted
text data. The `auk` package acts as a front end for AWK, allowing users
to filter eBird data before import into R, and provides tools to perform
some important pre-processing of the data. Them name of this package
comes from the happy coincidence that the command line tool
[AWK](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html), upon which
the package is based, is pronounced the same as
[auk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auk), the family of sea birds also
known as Alcids.

This post will demonstrate how to use `auk` to extract eBird data for
two bird species (Swainson’s and Bicknell’s Thrush) in New Hampshire,
then use these data to produce some maps comparing the distributions of
these species.

### Installation

This package is available on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=auk) and can be installed
with:

``` r
install.packages("auk")
```

The development version can be installed [from GitHub](https://github.com/CornellLabofOrnithology/auk/) using `devtools`. Windows users should use this development version since it fixes a bug present in the CRAN version:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CornellLabofOrnithology/auk")
```

`auk` requires the Unix utility AWK, which is available on most Linux
and Mac OS X machines. Windows users will first need to install
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) before using this package. Note that
**Cygwin should be installed in the default location**
(`C:/cygwin/bin/gawk.exe` or `C:/cygwin64/bin/gawk.exe`) in order for
`auk` to work.

### Accessing the data

Access to the full eBird dataset is provided via two large,
tab-separated text files. The eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) contains the
bird observation information and consists of one line for each
observation of a species on a checklist. The Sampling Event Data
contains just the checklist-level information (e.g. time and date,
location, and search effort information) and consists of one line for
each checklist.

To obtain the eBird data, begin by [creating an eBird account and
signing in](https://secure.birds.cornell.edu/cassso/login). eBird data
are freely available; however, you will need to [request
access](https://ebird.org/ebird/data/request) in order to obtain the EBD.
Filling out the data request form allows eBird to keep track of the
number of people using the data and obtain information on the
applications for which the data are used.

Once you have access to the data, proceed to the [download
page](https://ebird.org/ebird/data/download/ebd). Download and uncompress
(twice\!) both the EBD and the corresponding Sampling Event Data. Put
these two large text files somewhere sensible on either your computer’s
hard drive or an external drive, and remember the location of containing
folder.

### Using `auk`

There are essentially five main tasks that `auk` is designed to
accomplish, and I’ll use a simple example to demonstrate each in turn:

1.  Cleaning
2.  Filtering
3.  Importing
4.  Pre-processing
5.  Zero-filling

Let’s start by loading the required packages and defining a variable for
the path to the folder that contains both the EBD sand sampling event
data.

``` r
library(auk)
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(tigris)
library(viridisLite)
# path to ebird data
# change this to the location where you saved the data
ebd_dir <- "/Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_relMay-2018" 
```

#### 1\. Cleaning

Some rows in the EBD may have special characters in the comments fields
(for example, tabs) that will cause import errors, and the dataset has
an extra blank column at the end. The function `auk_clean()` drops these
problematic records and removes the blank column. In addition, you can
use `remove_text = TRUE` to remove free text entry columns, including
the comments and location and observation names. These fields are
typically not required and removing them can significantly decrease file
size.

This process should be run on both the EBD and sampling event data. It
typically takes several hours for the full EBD; however, it only needs
to be run once because the output from the process is saved out to a new
tab-separated text file for subsequent use. After running `auk_clean()`,
you can delete the original, uncleaned data files to save space

``` r
# ebd
f <- file.path(ebd_dir, "ebd_relMay-2018.txt")
f_clean <- file.path(ebd_dir, "ebd_relMay-2018_clean.txt")
auk_clean(f, f_out = f_clean, remove_text = TRUE)
# sampling
f_sampling <- file.path(ebd_dir, "ebd_sampling_relMay-2018.txt")
f_sampling_clean <- file.path(ebd_dir, "ebd_sampling_relMay-2018_clean.txt")
auk_clean(f, f_out = f_sampling_clean, remove_text = TRUE)
```

#### 2\. Filtering

The EBD is huge\! If we’re going to work with it, we need to extract a
manageable subset of the data. With this in mind, the main purpose of
`auk` is to provide a variety of functions to define taxonomic, spatial,
temporal, or effort-based filters. To get started, we’ll use `auk_ebd()`
to set up a reference to the EBD. We’ll also provide a reference to the
sampling event data. This step is optional, but it will allow us to
apply exactly the same set of filters (except for taxonomic filters) to
the sampling event data and the EBD. We’ll see why this is valuable
later.

``` r
# define the paths to ebd and sampling event files
f_in_ebd <- file.path(ebd_dir, "ebd_relMay-2018_clean.txt")
f_in_sampling <- file.path(ebd_dir, "ebd_sampling_relMay-2018_clean.txt")
# create an object referencing these files
auk_ebd(file = f_in_ebd, file_sampling = f_in_sampling)
#> Input 
#>   EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_relMay-2018/ebd_relMay-2018_clean.txt 
#>   Sampling events: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_relMay-2018/ebd_sampling_relMay-2018_clean.txt 
#> 
#> Output 
#>   Filters not executed
#> 
#> Filters 
#>   Species: all
#>   Countries: all
#>   States: all
#>   Spatial extent: full extent
#>   Date: all
#>   Start time: all
#>   Last edited date: all
#>   Protocol: all
#>   Project code: all
#>   Duration: all
#>   Distance travelled: all
#>   Records with breeding codes only: no
#>   Complete checklists only: no
```

As an example, let’s extract records from New Hampshire for Bicknell’s
Thrush and Swainson’s Thrush from
[complete](http://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/1006361-are-you-reporting-all-species)
checklists in June of any year. Bicknell’s Thrush breeds at high
elevations in New England, such as the White Mountains of New Hampshire,
one of my favourite places in the Northeast. Swainson’s Thrush is a
related, and much more widespread species, that breeds at lower
elevations in the same area. While hiking in the White Mountains in the
early summer, I love listening for the turnover from Swainson’s to
Bicknell’s Thrush as I move up in elevation. Let’s see if this pattern
is reflected in the data.

Note that each filtering criterion corresponds to a different function,
all functions begin with `auk_` for easy auto-completion, and the
functions can be chained together to define multiple filters. Also,
printing the `auk_ebd` object will show which filters have been defined.

``` r
ebd_filters <- auk_ebd(f_in_ebd, f_in_sampling) %>% 
  auk_species(c("Bicknell's Thrush", "Swainson's Thrush")) %>% 
  auk_state("US-NH") %>% 
  auk_date(c("*-06-01", "*-06-30")) %>% 
  auk_complete()
ebd_filters
#> Input 
#>   EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_relMay-2018/ebd_relMay-2018_clean.txt 
#>   Sampling events: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_relMay-2018/ebd_sampling_relMay-2018_clean.txt 
#> 
#> Output 
#>   Filters not executed
#> 
#> Filters 
#>   Species: Catharus bicknelli, Catharus ustulatus
#>   Countries: all
#>   States: US-NH
#>   Spatial extent: full extent
#>   Date: *-06-01 - *-06-30
#>   Start time: all
#>   Last edited date: all
#>   Protocol: all
#>   Project code: all
#>   Duration: all
#>   Distance travelled: all
#>   Records with breeding codes only: no
#>   Complete checklists only: yes
```

This is just a small set of the potential filters, for a full list of
filters consult the
[documentation](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/reference/index.html#section-filter).

The above code only *defines* the filters, no data has actually been
extracted yet. To compile the filters into an AWK script and run it, use
`auk_filter()`. Since I provided an EBD and sampling event file to
`auk_ebd()`, both will be filtered and I will need to provide two output
filenames.

``` r
f_out_ebd <- "data/ebd_thrush_nh.txt"
f_out_sampling <- "data/ebd_thrush_nh_sampling.txt"
ebd_filtered <- auk_filter(ebd_filters, file = f_out_ebd, 
                           file_sampling = f_out_sampling)
```

Running `auk_filter()` takes a long time, typically a few hours, so
you’ll need to be patient.

#### 3\. Importing

Now that we have an EBD extract of a reasonable size, we can read it
into an R data frame. The files output from `auk_filter()` are just
tab-separated text files, so we could read them using any of our usual R
tools, e.g. `read.delim()`. However, `auk` contains functions
specifically designed for reading in EBD data. These functions choose
sensible variable names, set the data types of columns correctly, and
perform two important post-processing steps: taxonomic roll-up and
de-duplicating group checklists.

We’ll put the sampling event data aside for now, and just read in the
EBD:

``` r

```

#### 4\. Pre-processing

By default, two important pre-processing steps are performed to handle
taxonomy and group checklists. In most cases, you’ll want this to be
done; however, these can be turned off to get the raw data.

``` r
ebd_raw <- read_ebd(f_out_ebd, 
                    # leave group checklists as in
                    unique = FALSE,
                    # leave taxonomy as is
                    rollup = FALSE)
```

##### Taxonomic rollup

The [eBird
taxonomy](http://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/1006825-the-ebird-taxonomy)
is an annually updated list of all field recognizable taxa. Taxa are
grouped into eight different categories, some at a higher level than
species and others at a lower level. The function `auk_rollup()` (called
by default by `read_ebd()`) produces an EBD containing just true
species. The categories and their treatment by `auk_rollup()` are as
follows:

  - **Species:** e.g., Mallard.
  - **ISSF or Identifiable Sub-specific Group:** Identifiable subspecies
    or group of subspecies, e.g., Mallard (Mexican). Rolled-up to
    species level.
  - **Intergrade:** Hybrid between two ISSF (subspecies or subspecies
    groups), e.g., Mallard (Mexican intergrade. Rolled-up to species
    level.
  - **Form:** Miscellaneous other taxa, including recently-described
    species yet to be accepted or distinctive forms that are not
    universally accepted (Red-tailed Hawk (Northern), Upland Goose
    (Bar-breasted)). If the checklist contains multiple taxa
    corresponding to the same species, the lower level taxa are rolled
    up, otherwise these records are left as is.
  - **Spuh:** Genus or identification at broad level – e.g., duck sp.,
    dabbling duck sp.. Dropped by `auk_rollup()`.
  - **Slash:** Identification to Species-pair e.g., American Black
    Duck/Mallard). Dropped by `auk_rollup()`.
  - **Hybrid:** Hybrid between two species, e.g., American Black Duck x
    Mallard (hybrid). Dropped by `auk_rollup()`.
  - **Domestic:** Distinctly-plumaged domesticated varieties that may be
    free-flying (these do not count on personal lists) e.g., Mallard
    (Domestic type). Dropped by `auk_rollup()`.

`auk` contains the full eBird taxonomy as a data frame.

``` r

We can use one of the example datasets in the package to explore what
`auk_rollup()` does.

``` r
# get the path to the example data included in the package
f <- system.file("extdata/ebd-rollup-ex.txt", package = "auk")
# read in data without rolling up
ebd_wo_ru <- read_ebd(f, rollup = FALSE)
# rollup
ebd_w_ru <- auk_rollup(ebd_wo_ru)

# all taxa not identifiable to species are dropped
unique(ebd_wo_ru$category)
#> [1] "domestic"   "form"       "hybrid"     "intergrade" "slash"     
#> [6] "spuh"       "issf"       "species"
unique(ebd_w_ru$category)
#> [1] "species"

# yellow-rump warbler subspecies rollup
# without rollup, there are three observations
ebd_wo_ru %>%
  filter(common_name == "Yellow-rumped Warbler") %>% 
  select(checklist_id, category, common_name, subspecies_common_name, 
         observation_count)

```

##### Group checklists

eBird observers birding together can share checklists resulting in group
checklists. In the simplest case, all observers will have seen the same
set of species; however, observers can also add or remove species from
their checklist. In the EBD, group checklists result in duplicate
records, one for each observer. `auk_unique()` (called by default by
`read_ebd()`) de-duplicates the EBD, resulting in one record for each
species on each group checklist.

#### 5\. Zero-filling

So far we’ve been working with presence-only data; however, many
applications of the eBird data require presence-absence information.
Although observers only explicitly record presence, they have the option
of designating their checklists as “complete”, meaning they are
reporting all the species they saw or heard. With complete checklists,
any species not reported can be taken to have an implicit count of zero.
Therefore, by focusing on complete checklists, we can use the sampling
event data to “zero-fill” the EBD producing presence-absence data. This
is why it’s important to filter both the EBD and the sampling event data
at the same time; we need to ensure that the EBD observations are drawn
from the population of checklists defined by the sampling event data.

Given an EBD file or data frame, and corresponding sampling event data,
the function `auk_zerofill()` produces zero-filled, presence-absence
data.

``` r
zf <- auk_zerofill(f_out_ebd, f_out_sampling)
zf
#> Zero-filled EBD: 12,938 unique checklists, for 2 species.
zf$observations
#> # A tibble: 25,876 x 4
#>    checklist_id scientific_name    observation_count species_observed
#>    <chr>        <chr>              <chr>             <lgl>

The resulting `auk_zerofill` object is a list of two data frames:
`observations` stores the species’ counts for each checklist and
`sampling_events` stores the checklists. The `checklist_id` field can be
used to combine the files together manually, or you can use the
`collapse_zerofill()` function.

This zero-filled dataset is now suitable for applications such as
species distribution modeling.

### Applications of eBird data

Now that we’ve imported some eBird data into R, it’s time for the fun
stuff\! Whether we’re making maps or fitting models, most of the
application of eBird data will occur outside of `auk`; however, I’ll
include a couple simple examples here just to give you a sense for
what’s possible.

#### Making an occurrence map

One of the most obvious things to do with the species occurrence data is
to make a map\! Here I’ll compare the distributions of the two thrush
species.

``` r
# convert ebd to spatial object
ebd_sf <- ebd %>% 
  select(common_name, latitude, longitude) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)
# get state boundaries using rnaturalearth package
states <- ne_states(iso_a2 = c("US", "CA"), returnclass = "sf")
nh <- filter(states, postal == "NH") %>% 
  st_geometry()
# map
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "skyblue")
# set plot extent
plot(nh, col = NA)
# add state boundaries
plot(states %>% st_geometry(), col = "grey40", border = "white", add = TRUE)
plot(nh, col = "grey20", border = "white", add = TRUE)
# ebird data
plot(ebd_sf %>% filter(common_name == "Swainson's Thrush"), 
     col = "#4daf4a99", pch = 19, cex = 0.75, add = TRUE)
plot(ebd_sf %>% filter(common_name == "Bicknell's Thrush") %>% st_geometry(), 
     col = "#377eb899", pch = 19, cex = 0.75, add = TRUE)
```

Bicknell’s Thrush is a high elevation breeder and, as expected,
observations of this species are restricted to the White Mountains in
the North-central part of the state. In constrast, Swainson’s Thrush
occurs more widely throughout the state.

#### Mapping frequency of occurrence

The above map doesn’t account for effort. For example, is a higher
density of observations indicative of a biological pattern or of more
birders visiting an area? We can address this by using the zero-filled
data to produce maps of frequency of observation on checklists. To do
this, I’ll start by converting the eBird data into a spatial object in
`sf` format and projecting to an equal area coordinate reference system.

``` r
# pres-abs data by species
checklists_sf <- collapse_zerofill(zf) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) %>% 
  # project to equal area
  st_transform(crs ="+proj=laea +lat_0=44 +lon_0=-71.70") %>% 
  inner_join(ebird_taxonomy %>% 
               select(species_code, scientific_name, common_name),
             by = "scientific_name") %>% 
  select(species_code, common_name, scientific_name, species_observed)
```

Next, I’ll create a raster template from this spatial object consisting
of a regular 10km grid of cells. Then I use `rasterize()` to calculate
the observation frequency within each cell.

``` r
r_template <- raster(as(checklists_sf, "Spatial"))
res(r_template) <- 10000
species <- unique(checklists_sf$species_code)
r_freq <- map(species, ~ filter(checklists_sf, species_code == .) %>% 
    rasterize(r_template, field = "species_observed", fun = mean)) %>% 
  stack() %>% 
  setNames(species)
```

Finally, let’s visualize these data to compare the spatial patterns
between species.

``` r
par(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1), mfrow = c(1, 2))
for (sp in species) {
  common <- filter(ebird_taxonomy, species_code == sp) %>% 
    pull(common_name)
  # set plot extent
  plot(nh %>% st_transform(crs = projection(r_freq)), main = common)
  # land
  s <- states %>% st_transform(crs = projection(r_freq)) %>% st_geometry()
  plot(s, col = "grey60", border = NA, add = TRUE)
  # frequency data
  plot(r_freq[[sp]], breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101), col = viridis(100),
       legend = FALSE, add = TRUE)
  # state lines
  plot(s, col = NA, border = "white", add = TRUE)
}
# legend
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), new = TRUE)
fields::image.plot(zlim = c(0, 1), legend.only = TRUE, col = viridis(100),
                   smallplot = c(0.25, 0.75, 0.05, 0.08),
                   horizontal = TRUE,
                   axis.args = list(at = seq(0, 1, by = 0.25), 
                                    labels = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                                    fg = NA, col.axis = "black",
                                    lwd.ticks = 0, line = -1),
                   legend.args = list(text = "Observation Frequency", 
                                      side = 3, col = "black"))
```

Swainson’s Thrush are more widepsread and more frequently seen, while
Bicknell’s Thrush is constrained to the White Mountains, and both
species are uncommon in southern New Hampshire.

### `auk` vs. `rebird`

Those interested in eBird data may also want to consider
[`rebird`](https://github.com/ropensci/rebird), an R package that
provides an interface to the [eBird
APIs](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBirdAPIs). The
functions in `rebird` are mostly limited to accessing recent (
i.e. within the last 30 days) observations, although `ebirdfreq()` does
provide historical frequency of observation data. In contrast, `auk`
gives access to the full set of ~ 500 million eBird observations. For
most ecological applications, users will require `auk`; however, for
some use cases, e.g. building tools for birders, `rebird` provides a
quick and easy way to access data. `rebird` is part of the [species
occurrence data (`spocc`) suite](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc).

Users working with species occurrence data may be interested in
[`scrubr`](https://github.com/ropensci/scrubr), for cleaning biological
occurrence records, and the [rOpenSci taxonomy
suite](/blog/2017/07/27/taxonomy-suite/).
