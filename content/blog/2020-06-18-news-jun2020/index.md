### rOpenSci HQ

* rOpenSci, together with many expert community members, put together a guide to help researchers find open data available in R: [When Field or Lab Work is not an Option - Leveraging Open Data Resources for Remote Research](/blog/2020/05/19/covid-19-open-data/). The blog post has information on a few topical areas, as well as a table of rOpenSci packages for access to research data.

&nbsp;

### Software Peer Review

[Software peer review](/software-review/) is now accepting submissions again, after a pause in the interest of reducing load on reviewers and editors in light of the COVID-19 crisis.

Consider [submitting your package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html) or [volunteering to review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#whyreview).

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

&nbsp;

* Peter Desmet asked a question that many R package maintainers run in to: [What if raw data in package is too large?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-if-raw-data-in-package-is-too-large/1955)

### In the News

* [Why You Should Document Your Tests](https://hynek.me/articles/document-your-tests/)
    - Should you document your tests? [Scott](/author/scott-chamberlain/) says "I for one, only sometimes include comments in my tests, but perhaps they should be documented better?" Do you comment or document your tests? This blog post is about Python, but the ideas apply to any language.
