"Security" can be a daunting, scary, and (frankly) quite often a very boring topic. BUT!, we promise that this Community Call on May 7th will be informative, engaging, and enlightening (or, at least not boring)!

Applying security best practices is essential not only for developers or sensitive data storage but also for the everyday R user installing R packages, contributing to open source, working with APIs or remote servers. However, keeping up-to-date with security best practices and applying them meticulously requires significant effort and is difficult without expert knowledge. On this Call you’ll hear about how the `ropsec` package can help _you_ and you'll learn the inner secrets of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability throughout all your data science workflows.

100% of the contributors to this post agree this is a "must attend" event.


#### Agenda

1. Stefanie Butland - Welcome (3 min)
1. **Bob Rudis** - Zen and the art of ensuring confidentiality & integrity in analytics workflows (20 min)
1. **Ildi Czeller** - Authorization vs authentication explained through signing commits: why you should do it and how [`ropsec`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ropsec) helps you do it the right way (15 min)
1. Q & A (20 min)

🎤 See speaker bios below.
