The United States Deparment of Agriculture National Agricultural
Statistics Service ([USDA-NASS](https://www.nass.usda.gov/)) provides a wide range of agricultural
data that includes animal, crop, demographic, economic, and
environmental measures across a number of geographies and time periods.
This data is available by direct download or queriable via the
[Quick Stats](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) interface. While
the Quick Stats tool puts a large amount of data into the hands
of users, the interface can be frustrating, especially when trying
to access more than 50,000 records or hoping to automate downloading
data when new data is released. I developed
[rnassqs](https://ropensci.github.io/rnassqs/) as a solution to
these frustrations. rnassqs provides a simple R interface for
the Quick Stats API. By iterating over a set of parameters,
R users can make processing NASS data reproducible and automated.

### What is rnassqs and what can it do for you?

Succinctly, rnassqs will let you write an R script to download
data from the Quick Stats database. Accessing the Quick Stats API
requires a key, which can be requested here:

[https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api)

The rnassqs package can be installed from CRAN or from GitHub:

```{r}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("rnassqs")

# Install from github
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnassqs")

# Add the API key
nassqs_auth("<your api key>") # just for this session

# To add the API key permanently, add
#     NASSQS_TOKEN="<your api key>"
# to your .Renviron file, which can be accessed via
#     usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Data can then be downloaded by selecting query parameters. For example,
the following downloads corn yields from 2017 onward for counties in
Virginia and Pennsylvania

```{r}
df <- nassqs(commodity_desc = "CORN",
             year__GE = 2017,
             agg_level_desc = "COUNTY",
             state_alpha = c("VA", "PA"),
             statisticcat_desc = "YIELD")
```


### A real world use case

In a current working paper with coauthors Michael Brady and Kirti
Rajagopalan, all of us at Washington State University, I investigate
the relationship between climate and irrigated agriculture in the
western United States. USDA-NASS data is a crucial component of
the analysis, but can be complex to understand and download. For
example, the Census of Agriculture asks farmers to report the
number of acres in three different categories:

- land use (crop, pasture, wood, or other)
- harvested status (harvested or not)
- irrigation status (irrigated or not)

However, the census does not ask for acres under the full combination
of land uses, so they must be reconstructed to the extent possible.
This can be done manually, but is tedious and subject to possible
errors. Instead, the full set of acres reported can be downloaded
using rnassqs. A good strategy is to define the parameters for a set
of queries that won't change, and then add the specific parameters
iteratively. In this case, we can iterate over the type of acres but
keep the set of geographies and years the same for each query. To
keep data sizes small, we focus on Yakima County in Washington State.

```{r}
acre_params <- list(
  sector_desc = "ECONOMICS",
  commodity_desc = "AG LAND",
  agg_level_desc = "COUNTY",
  unit_desc = "ACRES",
  domain_desc = "TOTAL",
  domaincat_desc = "NOT SPECIFIED",
  county_name = "Yakima",
  state_alpha = "WA",
  year__GE = 1997, 
  year__LE = 2017)
```

Then, specifying the specific parameters as a list to be iterated over:

```{r}
var_params <- list(
  cropland = list(
    class_desc = "CROPLAND",
    prodn_practice_desc = "ALL PRODUCTION PRACTICES"
  ),
  pastureland = list(
    class_desc = "PASTURELAND, (EXCL CROPLAND & WOODLAND)",
    prodn_practice_desc = "ALL PRODUCTION PRACTICES"
  ),
  woodland = list(
    class_desc = "WOODLAND",
    prodn_practice_desc = "ALL PRODUCTION PRACTICES"
  ),
  other = list(
    class_desc = "(EXCL CROPLAND & PASTURELAND & WOODLAND)",
    prodn_practice_desc = "ALL PRODUCTION PRACTICES"
  ),
  cropland_harvested = list(
    class_desc = "CROPLAND, HARVESTED",
    prodn_practice_desc = "ALL PRODUCTION PRACTICES"
  ),
  cropland_harvested_irrigated = list(
    class_desc = "CROPLAND, HARVESTED",
    prodn_practice_desc = "IRRIGATED"
  ),
  irrigated = list(
    class_desc = "ALL CLASSES",
    prodn_practice_desc = "IRRIGATED"
  ),
  irrigated_excl_cropland_harvested = list(
    class_desc = "(EXCL HARVESTED CROPLAND)",
    prodn_practice_desc = "IRRIGATED"
  )
)
```

Now to actually download the data:

```{r}
data_list <- lapply(names(var_params), function(v) {
  # create a new parameter list from the base list
  params <- acre_params

  # Assign parameters for the specific variable in v
  vp <- var_params[[v]]
  for(p in names(vp)) { params[[p]] <- vp[[p]] }

  # Download the data
  d <- nassqs(params)
  remove(params)

  # Assign a variable for ease of tracking
  d$variable <- v

  # Add the data.frame to the list of data
  d
})

# Convert the list of data.frames to one data.frame
df <- dplyr::bind_rows(data_list) # with 'dplyr'
#df <- data.table::rbindlist(data_list) # with 'data.table'
#df <- do.call(rbind, data_list) # with base R
```

We can present a compact table of acres using tidyr:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
df %>%
  select(variable, year, Value) %>%
  spread(key = year, value = Value)
```

which generates a `data.frame` that looks like:

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2019-11-26-rnassqs/df1a.png" width = "800" alt = "Output of data.frame without converting to numeric." >}}


An important note: `nassqs()` retains the `character` type
of the `Value` column because there are often missing value
codes returned. Here we can see that `cropland` and `woodland`
have missing codes for 1997. Before doing any calculations
we want to convert the values to numeric, but also take note
of missing codes to help decide how to handle missing values.
In this case, we convert them to `NA` and can convert values to
numeric with

```{r}
df %>%
  select(variable, year, Value) %>%
  transmute(
    variable,
    year,
    value = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", Value))) %>%
  spread(key = year, value = value)
```

which generates a data.frame with values converted to numeric:

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2019-11-26-rnassqs/df2a.png" width = "800" alt = "Output of data.frame converted to numeric." >}}


### Developing and submitting your first R package to rOpenSci

I began development on rnassqs in the fall of 2017 when I was
confronted with having to manually download many different variables
for a number of different counties and years. Having never developed
an R package before, I found great use in two sources:

- Hadley's [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
- The httr package's vignette [Best practices for API Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)

After a year or so of unofficial releases and work,
[Hao Ye](https://twitter.com/Hao_and_Y) suggested I submit the package
to rOpenSci. It's hard to overstate the value of having two friendly
and thorough reviewers ([Adam Sparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks)
and [Neal Richardson](https://github.com/nealrichardson)) pour over
your package in detail. Their comments were extremely helpful (here
is the
[review thread](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/298))
and greatly improved the package in a number of ways:

- __Testing__: I initially had poorly organized and confusing tests,
largely because I had little experience. Luckily one Neal Richardson
wrote the [httptest](https://github.com/nealrichardson/httptest) package
that makes it easier to make mock API calls to test without making the actual
call to the API service, which becomes important for passing CRAN checks.
- __Documentation__: As the author of functions, it's hard to document
from the perspective of someone who is new to the function. The reviews
provided that perspective and made the documentation much clearer.
- __Simplicity__: The rnassqs code base was unecessarily complicated
when I initially submitted it. It was much cleaner, easier to understand,
and easier to maintain by the time the review was finished.

In addition, a benefit I consider on par with the above improvements to
rnassqs was the experience of interacting with reviewers. Both were
friendly and helpful and contributed time and energy far beyond what I
expected. Their example served as a strong cultural norm to guide my work
as a reviewer for a later package.

### In closing

In summary, there are two lessons in particular I hope to retain for future
work:

1. On the scale of simple but rigid to flexible but complex, I tend to
lean toward the latter too early, trying to abstract and complicate to avoid
repeating myself. I think my work would be cleaner, faster, and more coherent
if I kept a more narrow focus and thought at a meta level about package design
before diving in to write functions that encapsulate all possible use functions.
2. The benefit of other perspectives cannot be overstated. Getting feedback
earlier could have avoided unecessarily complicating the package code.

If you're interested in learning more about rnassqs, the
[package documentation](https://ropensci.github.io/rnassqs/) provides
an introduction and guide to use as well as a
[vignette with detailed examples](https://docs.ropensci.org/rnassqs/articles/rnassqs.html).
A goal going forward is to improve the ease of developing queries, which remains
difficult, requiring an understanding of the peculiarities of the Quick Stats
database. Some convenience functions like `nassqs_acres()` and `nassqs_yields()`
may help with that, but there must be better ways. The rnassqs
[repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/rnassqs) is the best place to
file issues or feature requests, both of which are very welcome.
