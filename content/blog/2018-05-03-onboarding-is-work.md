Our [onboarding process](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/), that
ensures that packages contributed by the community undergo a
transparent, constructive, non adversarial and open review process,
involves a lot of work from many actors: authors, reviewers and editors;
but *how much work*? Managing the effort involved in the peer-review
process is a major part of ensuring its sustainability and quality. In
this post, we’ll take a look at the effort put in by participants in the
review process, and also learn something about exploring GitHub data
along the way.

### Work done by authors

We can try to quantify the development work of authors by looking at the
number of lines deleted and added in the git repo of the package before,
during, and after review. By number of lines we mean number of lines in
any file in the repo so it can be lines of actual code and lines of docs
(in the README for instance). To do so, we link information from the
package git repos (information about sizes and dates of commits) and
information from the onboarding issue threads (start and end dates of
the review process, as measured by open/close dates).

``` r
library("ggplot2")
library("magrittr")

commits <- readr::read_csv("output/gitsum_reports.csv")
issues <- readr::read_csv("data/clean_data.csv")
issues <- dplyr::group_by(issues, package) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(opened = min(created_at),
                   closed = max(closed_at))
commits <- dplyr::left_join(commits, issues, by = "package")

custom_transf <- function(x){
  pof <- log(x)
  pof[x == 0] <- 0
  pof
}

custom_exp <- function(x){
  pof <- exp(x)
  pof[x < 0] <- - exp(-x)
  pof
}


plot_commits <- function(package_name, commits){
  message(package_name)
  example <- dplyr::filter(commits, package == package_name, !is_merge)

  p <- ggplot(example)   +
    geom_segment(aes(x = datetime, xend = datetime,
                     y = 0, yend = custom_transf(total_insertions)),
                 col = "salmon", size = 1) +
    geom_segment(aes(x = datetime, xend = datetime,
                     y = 0, yend = - custom_transf(total_deletions)), 
                 col = "blue", size = 1) +
    ylab("lines") +
    annotate("segment", 
             x = min(example$datetime),
             xend = max(example$datetime),
             y = 0, yend = 0,
             col = "grey50",
             size = 0.2) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(min(-custom_transf(example$total_deletions)),
                                   to = max(custom_transf(example$total_insertions)),
                                   by = 5), 
                       labels= round(custom_exp(seq(min(-custom_transf(example$total_deletions)),
                                         to = max(custom_transf(example$total_insertions)),
                                         by = 5))))+
    annotate("rect",
             xmin = example$opened[1], xmax = example$closed[1],
             ymin = - custom_transf(max(example$total_deletions)), 
             ymax = custom_transf(max(example$total_insertions)),
             fill = "grey80", alpha = 0.6,
             col = "grey10",
             size = 0.2) +
    ggtitle(package_name) +
    hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() 
  print(p)
}
```

Let’s have a look at a few packages. The x-axis represents time, and the
grey box the onboarding period (from issue opening i.e. submission to
issue closing i.e. approval). The salmon lines above the y-axis are the
number of lines *added* in one commit while the blue lines below the
y-axis are the number of lines *deleted* in one commit.

``` r
plot_commits("opencage", commits = commits)
```

![commits plot of the opencage
package](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

``` r
plot_commits("charlatan", commits = commits)
```

![commits plot of the charlatan
package](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

When looking at all onboarded repos, we don’t see a general pattern to
commit histories. Commits have diffent sizes, and the activity frequency
is highly variable. While we see the updates to packages that occur
during review, there is just as often change again after onboarding, as
packages continue to improve and be maintained. This highlights an
important aspect of our peer review, which is that acceptance is not the
end of the process. While we aim for the process to ensure high quality
at acceptance, packages are not static moving forward. Not all
deficiencies are detected by peer reviewers, and further improvements
and maintenance will continue. This is why many of our standards are
about maintainability, and our process is in part an approach to onboard
authors into a community of dedicated and supportive package
maintainers.

We do try to onboard mature packages, i.e. that are not *drafts*.
Furthermore, the absence of general patterns in the previous figures
could be due to different age at submission. How old are packages at
submission?

``` r
age <- commits %>%
  dplyr::group_by(package) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(age = difftime(min(opened), min(datetime), units = "weeks")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(age > 0)

library(hrbrthemes)
ggplot(age) +
  geom_dotplot(aes(age), binwidth = 5) +
  xlab("Age (weeks)") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16)
```

![age of packages at
submission](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

On this dotplot, the x-axis represents age at submission and each dot is
a package falling in that age bin. We say *apparent* age because the
first commit might happen a long time after the package was created,
although often one makes an initial commit not long after having started
to work. We needed to filter positive age because in one case the GitHub
repo of the onboarded package was apparently deleted and re-created
without history after approval. Such things happen, thankfully the
package wasn’t lost, just its history!

Many packages are submitted while still very young which might indicate
rapid development. It might also mean some authors viewed onboarding as
a part of development, i.e. authors knew they intended to submit quite
rapidly. For instance, Maëlle developed `opencage` in just a few days,
then submitted it to get it ready for wider use by the community.

### Work done by reviewers

How much effort is put in by reviewers in this process? Reviewer time
and effort is one of our most precious resources (you can read more
about reviewer motivations and perspectives in other blog posts by [Mara
Averick](/blog/2017/08/22/first-package-review/),
[Verena
Haunschmid](/blog/2017/09/08/first-review-experiences/),
[Charles T. Gray](/blog/2018/03/13/ode-to-testing/)
and [Miles
McBain](/blog/2018/04/06/peer-review-value/)). We
measure this effort by asking reviewers to self-report the hours spent
reviewing. We do so to understand the amount of effort we are asking
reviewers for, so we can let new reviewers know what to expect, and so
hopefully in the future we can measure the success of efforts to
automate some reviewer tasks.

``` r
# airtable data
# this is our private database of who's reviewed what
# and of reviewers' areas of expertise
airtable <- airtabler::airtable("appZIB8hgtvjoV99D", "Reviews")
airtable <- airtable$Reviews$select_all()
```

We have self-reported reviewing times for 136 of 184 reviews.

``` r
ggplot(airtable) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = review_hours, x = "")) +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
  ylab("Reviewing time (hours)")
```

![hours spent
reviewing](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

It appears to take our reviewers a similar amount of time to review R
packages as [scientists take to review a manuscript (5 hour median and 9
hour
mean)](https://publishingresearchconsortium.com/index.php/112-prc-projects/research-reports/peer-review-in-scholarly-journals-research-report/142-peer-review-in-scholarly-journals-perspective-of-the-scholarly-community-an-international-study).

One potential question is whether reviewer time is affected by the size
of the package reviewed as measured by for instance number of exports
(classes and functions).

``` r
get_namespace <- function(package_name){
  message(package_name)
  local_path_archive <- paste0(getwd(), "/repos_at_submission/", package_name)
  if(length(fs::dir_ls(local_path_archive)) != 0){
    ns <- devtools::parse_ns_file(local_path_archive)
    tibble::tibble(package = package_name, 
                   exports = length(ns$exports) +
                     length(ns$exportClasses))
  }else{
    return(NULL)
  }
}

packages <- fs::dir_ls("repos_at_submission") 
packages <- stringr::str_replace_all(packages, "repos_at_submission\\/", "")
purrr::map_df(packages, get_namespace) %>%
  readr::write_csv("output/namespace.csv")
```

Interestingly, we find no relationship between the reviewing time and
number of exports:

``` r
namespace_ro <- readr::read_csv("output/namespace.csv")
namespace_ro <- dplyr::left_join(namespace_ro, airtable, by = "package")
ggplot(namespace_ro) +
  geom_point(aes(exports, review_hours)) +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16) +
  ylab("Reviewing time (hours)") +
  xlab("No. of exports")
```

![](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/scatterplot-size-vs-reviewing-time-1.png)

There are a few potential explanations to this that might be fruitful to
explore. For instance, does this mean that there’s only so much time,
and so larger packages get less scrutiny per line of code or per export?
Or does review time just depend more on the reviewer than the package?

### Work done by editors

Editors manage the review process, performing initial package checks,
identifying and contacting reviewers, and then moderating and cajoling
the process forward. Our best measure for editor effort is the number of
packages handled by an editor in a given time frame, which we can track
from the assignments on GitHub issues since the start of onboarding.
Looking at this over time, we can see how editor workloads changed in
response to growing number of assignments and how we have attempted to
manage this by expanding our editorial board:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(gh)
library(lubridate)

issues <- gh("/repos/ropensci/software-review/issues?state=all&labels=package", .limit=1000)

edits = map_df(issues,
~data_frame(url = .$html_url,
editor = .$assignee$login %||% NA_character_,
opened = as.Date(.$created_at))) %>%
filter(!is.na(editor)) %>%
mutate(quarter = paste(year(opened), quarter(opened), sep="Q"),
half =  paste(year(opened), if_else(quarter(opened) <= 2, 1, 2), sep="H"),
year = year(opened))

edits %>%
group_by(editor, half) %>%
summarize(n_assigned = n()) %>%
{ full_join(., crossing(editor = unique(.$editor),  #can't get expand() to work.
half = unique(.$half))) } %>%
mutate(n_assigned = coalesce(n_assigned, 0L)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=half, y=n_assigned, fill=editor)) +
geom_col(position="dodge") +
geom_hline(yintercept = c(3, 6)) +
xlab("Half / Year") + ylab("No. Issues Handled")+
    hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

![number of assignments per editor per half a
year](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

As an side-note, the same data allows to visualize the increase in the
number of submissions.

``` r
edits %>%
group_by(half) %>%
summarize(n_submissions = n()) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=half, y=n_submissions)) +
geom_col(position="dodge") +
xlab("Half / Year") + ylab("No. Submissions")+
    hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() 
```

year](/img/blog-images/2018-05-03-onboarding-is-work/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

### Outlook: decreasing work by automation

As mentioned [in this blog post about the authors and reviewers
survey](/blog/2018/04/17/author-survey/), we’re in
the process of trying to maximize automation of all than can be
automated in order to reduce and simplify work for everyone involved.
This way, humans can focus on what they’re best at. Our current
automation efforts include two packages in development: one for package
authors, [`rodev`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rodev), by rOpenSci
staff, and one for package reviewers,
[`pkgreviewr`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkgreviewr), by community
member (and guest editor!) [Anna
Krystalli](http://www.annakrystalli.com/). We also are working on
automating most of the checks that use `goodpractice::gp` so they are
run on CI infrastructure automatically on submission, rather than
requiring editors to do so locally.
