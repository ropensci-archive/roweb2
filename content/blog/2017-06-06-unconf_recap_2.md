Following up on Stefanie's recap of [unconf 17](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017), we are following up this entire week with summaries of projects developed at the event. We plan to highlight 4-5 projects each day, with detailed posts from a handful of teams to follow.

## `checkers`

**Summary:**  `checkers` is a framework for reviewing analysis projects. It provides automated checks for best practices, using extensions on the goodpractice package.

In addition, checkers includes a [descriptive guide for best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYcWJUk-MiM2C1TIHB1Rn6rXoF5fHwRX-7_C12Blx8g/edit#).

## `gramr`

**Summary:** `gramr` is a package that wraps the command line tool [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) to provide grammar checking functions for Rmd or md documents. It can be used as an RStudio Addin, or from the console or command line by supplying an Rmd or md filename.

p.s. Two of the three (Ben/Gordon) were remote participants.
