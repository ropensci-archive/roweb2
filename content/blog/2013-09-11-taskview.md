There is an increasing set of R packages for interacting with the web from R, whether it be the low level tools to interact with the web via http (see [RCurl][RCurl] and [httr][httr]), parsing data from the web (like [RJSONIO][RJSONIO] and [XML][XML]), or wrappers to web APIs that provide data (like [twitteR][twitteR]).

Most of you probably know about [CRAN Task Views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) that aggregate information about R packages and functions on a particular subject area into a simple web page. There isn't one for interacting with the web, so we have started drafting one on Github, and it is below.

Let us know what you think should be changed in comments below, or ideally, send a pull request on Github [at the repo](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices).

# CRAN Task View: Working with data on the web

* Maintainer: Scott Chamberlain, Karthik Ram, Christopher Gandrud
* Contact:	scott at ropensci.org
* Version:	2013-09-09

## Introduction

This Task View contains information about using R to obtain and parse data from the web.

The base version of R does not ship with many tools for interacting with the web. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large number of tools for interacting with the web.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements, then please contact the maintainer.

A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of activity.

## Tools for working with the web from R

### curl/http/ftp

* [RCurl][RCurl]: a low level curl wrapper.
* [httr][httr]: is a light wrapper around RCurl that makes many things easier, but still allows you to access the lower level functionality of RCurl.

httr has convenient http verbs: GET(), POST(), PUT(), DELETE(), PATCH(), HEAD(), BROWSE(). These wrap functions in RCurl, making them more convenient to use, though less configurable than counterparts in RCurl. The equivalent of httr's GET() in RCurl is getForm(). Likewise, the equivalent of httr's POST() in RCurl is postForm().

### Web frameworks

RStudio recently created [Shiny][shiny], which combines R, html, css, and javascript to make web applications. Related tools are available, including [openCPU][opencpu] and [Rook][rook]. However, Shiny is the most promising of these.

### Parsing data from the web

* txt, csv, etc.: you can use `read.csv()` after acquiring the csv file from the web via e.g., `getURL()` from RCurl. The [repmis][repmis] package contains a `source_data` command to simplify this process, while also assigning SHA-1 hashes to uniquely identify file versions.
* xml/html: the package [XML][XML] by Duncan Temple-Lang contains functions for parsing xml and html, and supports [xpath][xpath] for searching xml (think regex for strings).
* json/json-ld: [RJSONIO][RJSONIO] by Duncan Temple-Lang. Another package, [rjson][rjson], does many of the same tasks which RJSONIO does.
* custom formats: Some web APIs provide custom data formats (e.g., X), which are usually modified xml or json, and handled by XML and RJSONIO, respectively.
