After Stefanie's general recap of [unconf 18](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2018/05/28/unconf2018), this week the blog will feature summaries of projects developed at the event: each day 4 to 5 projects will be highlighted. Later this year a handful of teams will post more thorough posts about their work.
