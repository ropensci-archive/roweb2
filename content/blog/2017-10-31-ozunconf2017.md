Just last week we organised the 2nd rOpenSci [ozunconference](http://ozunconf17.ropensci.org), the sibling rOpenSci unconference, held in Australia. Last year it was [held in Brisbane](http://auunconf.ropensci.org), this time around, the ozunconf was hosted in Melbourne, from October 27-27, 2017. We brought together 45 R-software users and developers, scientists, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profits.

What we created was a bunch of awesome individuals from 12 different countries. Before the ozunconf we discussed and dreamt up projects to work on for a few days, then met up and brought about a bakers dozen of them into reality.

### Upskilling participants

We ran a half day training session on how to develop R packages and share them on GitHub. We had 15 students come along to be instructed by [Roger Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng) and myself on creating an R package and then putting it up on GitHub. The participants really picked things up quickly, and by the end of the session, everyone could make an R package, push it to Git, and was also introduced to the wonders of RMarkdown. The event then kicked on to the [Melbourne R Ladies special one year anniversary talk](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Melbourne/events/244102535/), which featured a great talk and introduction to Random Forests by Elisabeth Vogel.

### Bringing people together

Before the ozunconf, we discussed various ideas for projects in GitHub issues. Things really started to pick up in the last week and we ended up at 41 issues - almost as many issues as participants.

Day one kicked off with some decorating some hex cookies, baked by Di Cook. This uncovered a fun fact that [Stefan Milton Bache](http://stefanbache.dk/) - creator of the [`magrittr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr) package, apparently created the first #rstats hex sticker. The venue even seemed to reflect our love of hex stickers, providing a nice hex sticker carpet:

We then stuck the various projects that had been discussed throughout the week around the room and participants sticker voted on projects that they were interested in working on. Introductions were made, and quotes like these made for entertaining discussions around data:

We were really lucky to be in the beautiful Monash City Campus, a place that almost seems to have been designed for an unconf, with some classroom style space, as well as plenty of nooks and cranny's to sit in, including an outdoor astroturfed garden complete with bean bags and native flora.

We had some great sponsors for this event, including of course [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/) [The RConsortium](http://r-consortium.org/), [The Ingham Institute](https://inghaminstitute.org.au/), and [Monash Business School](http://www.monash.edu/business).

We wrapped up at the end of day 2, giving each projects group three minutes to debrief on their projects, using the unconf style - only the README.md (mostly!). You can [check out all the ozunconf projects here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/ozunconf-projects/), thanks to a template from [Sean Kross](http://seankross.com/), soon we'll publish a series of short posts covering all of these great fun projects.

Here's a quick taster:

- [`realtime`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/realtime). Realtime streamingplots built on the p5.js library.

- [`stow`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ozrepro). A simplified version control interface to git, from within R.

- [icon](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/icon). Easily access and insert web icons into HTML and PDF documents.

- [`ochRe`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ochRe). Provide Australia-themed Colour Palettes.

We'll share a quick summary of all of the projects over the coming weeks.

### Introducing people to the community.

rOpenSci has had a profound impact on me and my work. At the end of 2015 I got in touch with them to discuss arranging an unconference in Australia, and they welcomed me and my friends. Today, I am proud to be welcoming those from the ozunconf to this big, kind, wonderful community, and say, as Shannon Ellis summed up: ["Hey! You there! You are welcome here"](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/23/community/). It was also really great to have a diverse group of participants at the ozunconf, and in particular, that we had 40% of participants from women or other underrepresented genders.

### Starts, not ends

One thing that I've realised in my involvement with organising and attending these events is that when the unconf ends, it feels a bit sad, sure, to say goodbye to the environment, the community, the friends, and the projects. At the last unconf in LA, we were sending out a stream of tweets, "[it's not](https://twitter.com/nj_tierney/status/868572134548713472) [over](https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain/status/868590677843599360) [until](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/868605633435533312) [it's](https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain/status/869044724086185985) [over](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/869664700606406656). But, in reflection, standing back, taking it all in, the unconference doesn't really end - it just begins. It begins many new things - projects, ideas, collaborations, and friendships.

The ozunconf comes to an end. Now, let's get started.

# note:

Would love to include Steph de Silva's tweet thread somehow:


Key lessons from #ozunconf:
- The opportunity to try but not succeed is a luxury to be savoured
- Mistakes make you a better programmer
- The best thing about R isn't the language, it's the number of people around who want to help
- Your skills are valuable, so your productivity is too. Investing in the tools that maximise it is worthwhile.
- git really is out to get you. n/n
