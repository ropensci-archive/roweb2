Phylogenetic trees are commonly used to present evolutionary relationships of species. [Newick](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html) is the *de facto* format in phylogenetic for representing tree(s). [Nexus](http://wiki.christophchamp.com/index.php?title=NEXUS_file_format) format incorporates Newick tree text with related information organized into separated units known as blocks. For the R community, we have [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ape) and [phylobase](https://cran.r-project.org/package=phylobase) packages to import trees from Newick and Nexus formats. However, analysis results (tree + analysis findings) from widely used software packages in this field are not well supported. Some of them are extended from Newick and Nexus (*e.g.* [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/intro.html) and [BEAST](http://beast2.org/) outputs), while some of the others are just log files (*e.g.* [r8s](http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s) and [PAML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html) outputs). Parsing these output files is important for interpreting analysis findings.

Information associated with taxon species/strains can be meta-data (*e.g.* isolation host, time and location, *etc.*), phenotypic or experimental data. These data as well as analysis finding may be further analyzed in the evolutionary context for downstream integrative and comparative studies. Unfortunately, taxon-associated data are mostly stored in separate files and often in inconsistent formats. To fill this gap, I developed the [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) package for phylogenetic tree data integration.

Currently, [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) is able to read the following file formats: Newick, Nexus, New Hampshire eXtended format (NHX), jplace and Phylip as well as the data outputs from the following analysis programs: [BEAST](http://beast2.org/), [EPA](http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/epa/index.html), [HyPhy](https://veg.github.io/hyphy-site/), [MrBayes](http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/), [PAML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html), [PHYLDOG](https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/phyldog/), [pplacer](http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/), [r8s](http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s), [RAxML](http://evomics.org/learning/phylogenetics/raxml/) and [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/intro.html).

Importing trees with data
-------------------------

### Importing tree data from software outputs

The [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) package provides several parser functions as illustrated in the following table:

| Parser function  | Description                                                               |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read.beast       | parsing output of BEAST                                                   |
| read.codeml      | parsing output of CodeML (rst and mlc files)                              |
| read.codeml\_mlc | parsing mlc file (output of CodeML)                                       |
| read.hyphy       | parsing output of HYPHY                                                   |
| read.jplace      | parsing jplace file including output of EPA and pplacer                   |
| read.mrbayes     | parsing output of MrBayes                                                 |
| read.newick      | parsing newick string, with ability to parse node label as support values |

For example, users can parse [BEAST](http://beast2.org/) output using `read.beast` function. All the information inferred by by [BEAST](http://beast2.org/) will be stored in the output object.

``` r
file <- system.file("extdata/BEAST", "beast_mcc.tree", package="treeio")
beast <- read.beast(file)
beast
```

    ## 'treedata' S4 object that stored information of
    ##  '/Library/R/library/treeio/extdata/BEAST/beast_mcc.tree'.
    ## 
    ## ...@ phylo: 
    ## Phylogenetic tree with 15 tips and 14 internal nodes.
    ## 
    ## Tip labels:
    ##  A_1995, B_1996, C_1995, D_1987, E_1996, F_1997, ...
    ## 
    ## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
    ## 
    ## with the following features available:
    ##  'height',   'height_0.95_HPD',  'height_median',    'height_range', 'length',
    ##  'length_0.95_HPD',  'length_median',    'length_range', 'posterior',    'rate',
    ##  'rate_0.95_HPD',    'rate_median',  'rate_range'.

### Linking external data to phylogeny

In addition to analysis findings that are associated with the tree as we showed above, there is a wide range of heterogeneous data, including phenotypic data, experimental data and clinical data *etc.*, that need to be integrated and linked to phylogeny. For example, in the study of viral evolution, tree nodes may be associated with epidemiological information, such as location, age and subtype. To facilitate data integration, [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) provides `full_join` method to link external data to phylogeny as demonstrated below:

``` r
x <- data_frame(label = as.phylo(beast)$tip.label, trait = rnorm(Ntip(beast)))
full_join(beast, x, by="label")
```

    ## 'treedata' S4 object that stored information of
    ##  '/Library/R/library/treeio/extdata/BEAST/beast_mcc.tree'.
    ## 
    ## ...@ phylo: 
    ## Phylogenetic tree with 15 tips and 14 internal nodes.
    ## 
    ## Tip labels:
    ##  A_1995, B_1996, C_1995, D_1987, E_1996, F_1997, ...
    ## 
    ## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
    ## 
    ## with the following features available:
    ##  'height',   'height_0.95_HPD',  'height_median',    'height_range', 'length',
    ##  'length_0.95_HPD',  'length_median',    'length_range', 'posterior',    'rate',
    ##  'rate_0.95_HPD',    'rate_median',  'rate_range',   'trait'.

``` r
N <- Nnode2(beast)
y <- data_frame(node = 1:N, fake_trait = rnorm(N), another_trait = runif(N))
full_join(beast, y, by="node")
```

    ## 'treedata' S4 object that stored information of
    ##  '/Library/R/library/treeio/extdata/BEAST/beast_mcc.tree'.
    ## 
    ## ...@ phylo: 
    ## Phylogenetic tree with 15 tips and 14 internal nodes.
    ## 
    ## Tip labels:
    ##  A_1995, B_1996, C_1995, D_1987, E_1996, F_1997, ...
    ## 
    ## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
    ## 
    ## with the following features available:
    ##  'height',   'height_0.95_HPD',  'height_median',    'height_range', 'length',
    ##  'length_0.95_HPD',  'length_median',    'length_range', 'posterior',    'rate',
    ##  'rate_0.95_HPD',    'rate_median',  'rate_range',   'fake_trait',
    ##  'another_trait'.

### Combining tree data

To allow comparative study, [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) supports combining multiple phylogenetic trees into one with their node/branch-specific attribute data.

The following example merges a tree analyzed by [BEAST](http://beast2.org/) and [CODEML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html).

``` r
beast_file <- system.file("examples/MCC_FluA_H3.tree", package="ggtree")
rst_file <- system.file("examples/rst", package="ggtree")
mlc_file <- system.file("examples/mlc", package="ggtree")
beast_tree <- read.beast(beast_file)
codeml_tree <- read.codeml(rst_file, mlc_file)

merged_tree <- merge_tree(beast_tree, codeml_tree)
merged_tree
```

    ## 'treedata' S4 object that stored information of
    ##  '/Library/R/library/ggtree/examples/MCC_FluA_H3.tree',
    ##  '/Library/R/library/ggtree/examples/rst',
    ##  '/Library/R/library/ggtree/examples/mlc'.
    ## 
    ## ...@ phylo: 
    ## Phylogenetic tree with 76 tips and 75 internal nodes.
    ## 
    ## Tip labels:
    ##  A/Hokkaido/30-1-a/2013, A/New_York/334/2004, A/New_York/463/2005, A/New_York/452/1999, A/New_York/238/2005, A/New_York/523/1998, ...
    ## 
    ## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
    ## 
    ## with the following features available:
    ##  'height',   'height_0.95_HPD',  'height_median',    'height_range', 'length',
    ##  'length_0.95_HPD',  'length_median',    'length_range', 'posterior',    'rate',
    ##  'rate_0.95_HPD',    'rate_median',  'rate_range',   'subs', 'AA_subs',  't',    'N',
    ##  'S',    'dN_vs_dS', 'dN',   'dS',   'N_x_dN',   'S_x_dS'.

After merging, the `merged_tree` object contains the whole set of node/branch attributes from both `beast_tree` and `codeml_tree`. The tree object can be converted to tidy data frame using [tidytree](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidytree) package and visualized as hexbin scatterplot of *d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>*, *d<sub>N</sub>* and *d<sub>S</sub>* inferred by [CODEML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html) versus *rate* (substitution rate in unit of substitutions/site/year) inferred by [BEAST](http://beast2.org/) on the same branches, as an example to demonstrate comparison of node attributes inferred by different software.

``` r
library(tidytree)
library(ggplot2)

as_data_frame(merged_tree) %>%
    dplyr::select(dN_vs_dS, dN, dS, rate) %>%
    subset(dN_vs_dS >=0 & dN_vs_dS <= 1.5) %>%
    tidyr::gather(type, value, dN_vs_dS:dS) %>%
    ggplot(aes(rate, value)) + geom_hex() +
    facet_wrap(~factor(type, levels = c('dN_vs_dS', 'dN', 'dS')),
               scale='free_y') +
    ylab(NULL)
```

![hexbin scatter plot: correlation of dN/dS with substitution rate](/img/blog-images/2018-05-01-treeio/hexbin-scatterplot.png)

With this feature, users are able to compare/integrate evolutionary inferences obtained from different software packages/models.
