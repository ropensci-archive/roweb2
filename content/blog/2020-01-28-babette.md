[babette](https://docs.ropensci.org/babette/) [^1] is a package to work with BEAST2 [^2],
a software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis from R.

babette is a spin-off of my own academic research.
As a PhD I work on models of diversification: mathematical descriptions
of how species form new species. Instead of working on a species'
individuals, I work on species as evolutionary lineages.
A good way to show the evolutionary relationships between species
are phylogenies. For example, this is a phylogeny, with four species,
eloquently named '1', '2', '3' and '4':

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2020-01-28-babette/phylogeny.png" alt = "A phylogeny with four species" >}}

In my research, I simulate thousands of these. I call these
phylogenies 'the truth'. Then I wonder, would such a phylogeny actually
be true, how well would we be able to infer it? I say 'infer', instead
of 'measure', as we cannot measure phylogenies directly in nature.

In nature, however, we can sequence the DNA of species. From these DNA
sequences, we use software to neatly arrange these sequences, creating
a DNA alignment. Such DNA alignments are where most researchers start from.
Here is such an alignment, of four (eloquently named) species
and their aligned DNA sequences, in which a different color represents a
different nucleotide (an individual element of a DNA sequence):

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2020-01-28-babette/alignment.png" width = "600" alt = "A DNA alignment of four species" >}}

It is hard to only guess by eye which of the four species are most related.
Luckily, we have software for such problems, for example, BEAST2.
BEAST2 is a Bayesian phylogenetic tool that infers a posterior
from a DNA alignment. The posterior contains multiple phylogenies,
in which those that are more likely are present more often. Here is what these
posterior trees look like when superimposed:

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2020-01-28-babette/densitree.png" width = "600" alt = "Posterior trees of four species" >}}

Spoiler: actually, the phylogeny shown was the true phylogeny
underlying the alignment! You can see the inference has
problems recovering it, as there is no single dominant phylogeny
visible, but a mixture of multiple ones instead.
Part of my research is to measure
exactly the difference between the original phylogeny and those
in the posterior. Therefore, I would not only need
thousands of phylogenies, but also thousands of posteriors.
There was a practical reason to make this go smoothly!

#### Before babette

Before babette existed, it would take three steps to plot
the phylogenies in a posterior:

Step|      Input      |   Tool  |        Output
----|-----------------|---------|-----------------------
   1|alignment        |BEAUti   |BEAST2 input file
   2|BEAST2 input file|BEAST2   |posterior files
   3|posterior files  |DensiTree|plot of the phylogenies

 1. Run BEAUti to create a BEAST2 input file
 2. Run BEAST2 to create a posterior
 3. Run DensiTree to plot the phylogenies in a posterior

BEAUti (I assume the pun to BEAST is intended) is a beginner-friendly program
with a graphical user interface. To analyse an alignment such as above,
one needs at least 7 mouse clicks or 3 keyboard commands to create
a BEAST2 input file. BEAST2 can be called from the command line to
read the input file and create a posterior saved as multiple files.
DensiTree is another beginner-friendly program with a graphical
user interface to load the phylogenies of a posterior and plot these.

Again, I would need thousands of these posteriors.
Doing these steps manually would be a drag and would cost me
thousands of mouse clicks.
Instead, I created babette to work with BEAST2 from R.

#### With babette

We are going to reproduce the workflow described above with babette.
First, we'll load babette into memory:

```
library(babette)
```

Again, babette is a package to work with BEAST2 from R.
The Bayesian inference of BEAST2 works on an alignment,
stored in FASTA format. This is what such a FASTA file looks like:

```
>1
gcaagagtaacccccgccaggagtaggggcctttttcctt
>2
aacatagcaacccccgccacgtgtgggggtctttttcctt
>3
gaatcactgtcccccttcacgatggtgtgtttttatttgt
>4
taaaaaaaaagactatcgaagggggtgggggtttttcctt
```

Well spotted, this FASTA file contains the same alignment as the picture above!

Say, we have this alignment stored as a file with the
name 'alignment.fasta' in our present working directory:

```
fasta_filename <- "alignment.fasta"

# Check if it really exists
stopifnot(file.exists(fasta_filename))
```

To obtain a BEAST2 posterior with babette, do:

```
output <- bbt_run(fasta_filename)
```

And plotting the posterior trees:

```
plot_densitree(
  output$alignment_trees,
  alpha = 0.01,
  consensus = as.character(c(1:4)),
  cex = 2.0,
  scaleX = TRUE,
  scale.bar = FALSE
)
```

Note that for plotting the posterior trees, I've added many arguments to
make it a beautiful blog post picture :-)

#### More about babette

babette actually is a suite of five packages,
calling and/or offering an alternative for the BEAST2 tool suite:

What                                   |BEAST2 suite|babette suite
---------------------------------------|------------|-------------
Create a BEAST2 input file             |BEAUti      |beautier
Run (only) BEAST2                      |beast       |beastier
Visualize posterior parameter estimates|Tracer      |tracerer
Visualize posterior phylogenies        |DensiTree   |babette
Install BEAST2 packages                |BEAUti      |mauricer

The BEAST2 tool suite has - at the moment - more functionality than babette.
The [babette GitHub page](https://github.com/ropensci/babette) has a place where feature requests can be and
are made. If you want something added and you volunteer to help (that is,
answer my naive questions and testing that feature), let me know!

Although babette may not have all BEAST2 functionality,
babette already helped me create thousands of posteriors from an R script!
Also the analysis done in this blog post, can be found
at the [babette GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci/babette/blob/master/scripts/ropensci_create_figs_blog_post.R).

#### Why rOpenSci

I enjoy having my academic manuscripts reviewed.
We expect the articles we read to be clear and the opinion
of our peers help achieve this for our own work.
But when I read/run the code in the unreviewed
supplementary materials section, there is a loss in
clarity. Same goes for R packages written by academics:
the article that describes these packages are well-written,
but the actual code can be cumbersome to work with.
To set a good example, I wanted my code reviewed.

I enjoy having my code reviewed. Even when trying to
write exemplary and spotless code, reviewers usually
expose the weaker spots in the software.
My rOpenSci reviewers did an excellent job at that indeed!
Thanks to them, I think babette went from a good package to
an excellent one.
