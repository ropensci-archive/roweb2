In the last 12 months we traveled all over the world delivering talks and hands on workshops at various conferences and universities. This was a great opportunity for us to raise awareness for the project and get more of you involved as contributors and collaborators. As we scale the project to the next level, we need your help in spreading the message.

Today we would like to officially announce the rOpenSci Ambassadors program. To facilitate more discussion about rOpenSci tools and projects, we like to support our community members in running small workshops (perhaps a lunch time event), talks (lightning or longer talk at the next conference you attend),  hands on tutorials (for your grad department, seminar), or similar event.

**What the program entails**

The rOpenSci team will provide you with as much training material as you need (including notes and code), advice on structuring your discussion, guide to building a workshop slide deck and perhaps most importantly, funds to cover refreshments (coffee and snacks, or lunch), or some travel support to help you attend a meeting.

**Why become an ambassador**

- A shiny Ambassador badge for you on our community page (and one you can use elsewhere).
- Have refreshments on us when you give a demo or talk at your institution or we'll support travel (within reason) to a meeting.
- Free schwag. Currently only stickers but hopefully more.
- Satisfaction that you're playing an important role in supporting open science.


 If you're excited about organizing such an event, please [get in touch with us](/contact/) or spread the word to your colleagues.
