Introduction
------------

I never thought that I'd be programming software in my career. I started
using R little over 2 years now and it's been one of the most important
decisions in my career. Secluded in a small academic office with no one
to discuss/interact about my new hobbie, I started searching the web for
tutorials and packages. After getting to know how amazing and nurturing
the R community is, it made me want to become a data scientist. So I set
out to do it. Through out the journey I repeatedly found myself using
the [European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/), a
really neat dataset that collects informations on attitudes, beliefs and
behaviour patterns of diverse populations in more than thirty European
nations since 2002.

After seeing a niche in the R package community, I created the package
`essurvey` (previously `ess` in CRAN) to access this data easily from R.
The package was accepted in CRAN in September 2017 and was well received
among social scientists.

Over a month ago I submitted the package to rOpensci, intimidated but
very excited about the peer review process. To my surprise, the process
was enriching, respectful and transparent, unlike my previous experience
in academic research.

First steps
-----------

Using the `essurvey` package is fairly easy. There are are two main
families of functions: `import_*` and `show_*`. They each complement
each other and allow the user to almost never have to go to the European
Social Survey (ESS) website. The only scenario where you need to enter
the ESS website is to validate your email. If you haven't registered,
create an account at <http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/user/new> and
validate through your email.

Given that some `essurvey` functions require your email address, this
vignette will use a fake email but everything should work accordingly if
you registered with the ESS.

You can install the development version with

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("ropensci/essurvey")

or the stable version from CRAN with

    install.packages("essurvey")

Let's load the CRAN version and load it together with the `tidyverse`
set of packages to do some data manipulation.

    library(essurvey)
    library(tidyverse)

Downloading the ESS data requires validating your email everytime you
download data. We can set our email as an environment variable with
`set_email`.

    set_email("your@email.com")

Once that's executed you can delete the previous line and any `import_*`
call will look for the email automatically, stored as an environment
variable.

Exploring country data
----------------------

Let's suppose you don't know which countries or rounds (waves) are
available for the ESS. Then the `show_*` family of functions is your
friend.

To find out which countries have participated you can use
`show_countries()`

    show_countries()

    ##  [1] "Albania"            "Austria"            "Belgium"           
    ##  [4] "Bulgaria"           "Croatia"            "Cyprus"            
    ##  [7] "Czech Republic"     "Denmark"            "Estonia"           
    ## [10] "Finland"            "France"             "Germany"           
    ## [13] "Greece"             "Hungary"            "Iceland"           
    ## [16] "Ireland"            "Israel"             "Italy"             
    ## [19] "Kosovo"             "Latvia"             "Lithuania"         
    ## [22] "Luxembourg"         "Netherlands"        "Norway"            
    ## [25] "Poland"             "Portugal"           "Romania"           
    ## [28] "Russian Federation" "Slovakia"           "Slovenia"          
    ## [31] "Spain"              "Sweden"             "Switzerland"       
    ## [34] "Turkey"             "Ukraine"            "United Kingdom"

This function actually looks up the countries in the ESS website. If new
countries enter, this will automatically grab those countries as well.
Let's check out Spain. How many rounds has Spain participated in? We can
use `show_country_rounds()`

    sp_rnds <- show_country_rounds("Spain")
    sp_rnds

    ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Note that country names are case sensitive. Use the exact name printed
out by `show_countries()`.

Using this information, we can download those specific rounds easily
with `import_country`.

Note: Since `essurvey 1.0.0` all `ess_*` functions have been deprecated
in favour of the `import_*` and `download_*` functions.

    spain <-
      import_country(
        country = "Spain",
        rounds = 1:7
        )

`spain` will now be a list of `length(rounds)` containing a data frame
for each round. The `import_*` family is concerned with downloading the
data and thus always returns a list containing data frames unless only
one round is specified, in which it returns a `tibble`. Conversely, the
`show_*` family grabs information from the ESS website and always
returns vectors.

To download all rounds for a country automatically you can use
`import_all_cntrounds`.

    import_all_cntrounds("Spain")

Getting back to our example, ESS related datasets have missing
categories coded differently between questions. For example, questions
with scales from `1:5`, have missing categories such as "Don't know" and
"Refusal" coded between `7` and `10`. But questions with scales from
`1:10` are coded as `77`, `88` and `99`. `recode_missings` accepts a
`tibble` as a main argument and automatically returns a new `tibble`
with all missing values recoded as `NA`. You should checkout
`?recode_missings` for more details and elaborated examples.

**Note**: I urge the reader not to recode these categories to missing
without previously investigating the importance of these categories.

For example, let's recode missing values in all Spanish waves, bind them
into one single `tibble` and visualize how satisfied are Spaniards with
their government. First, let's extract a cleaner data.

    semi_cleaned <-
      spain %>% 
      map(recode_missings) %>% 
      bind_rows() %>% 
      mutate(name = str_sub(name, end = 4)) %>% 
      select(name, stfgov)

    semi_cleaned

    ## # A tibble: 13,543 x 2
    ##    name  stfgov
    ##    <chr>  <dbl>
    ##  1 ESS1      0.
    ##  2 ESS1      0.
    ##  3 ESS1      5.
    ##  4 ESS1      5.
    ##  5 ESS1      4.
    ##  6 ESS1      7.
    ##  7 ESS1      2.
    ##  8 ESS1      2.
    ##  9 ESS1      3.
    ## 10 ESS1      3.
    ## # ... with 13,533 more rows

There we go. The scale of `stfgov` is between `0` and `10`, let's
collapse that into smaller categories, calculate the percentage of
respondents within each category and visualize the change over time.

    semi_cleaned %>% 
      mutate(stfgov = case_when(stfgov <= 3 ~ "Low",
                                between(stfgov, 4, 6) ~ "Mid",
                                stfgov >= 7 ~ "High"),
             stfgov = factor(stfgov, levels = c("Low", "Mid", "High"))) %>%
      count(name, stfgov) %>% 
      group_by(name) %>% 
      mutate(perc = n / sum(n)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(name, perc, group = stfgov, colour = stfgov)) +
      geom_line() +
      theme_bw() +
      labs(x = "ESS rounds", y = "Satisfaction with Government (%)") +
      scale_colour_discrete(name = NULL)

![](/img/blog-images/2018-04-22-essurvey/spain_stf-1.png)

Looks like Spaniards are very unhappy with their government!

Exploring data by waves
-----------------------

Similarly to `import_country`, we can use other functions to download
rounds containing all countries. To see which rounds are currently
available, use `show_rounds`.

    show_rounds()

    ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Similar to `show_countries`, `show_rounds` interactively looks up rounds
in the ESS website, so any future rounds will automatically be included.

To download selected rounds, you can use `import_rounds`.

    selected_rounds <- import_rounds(1:7)

Alternatively, use `import_all_rounds` to download all available rounds.

    all_rounds <- import_all_rounds()

To build on the previous example, we can compare two different countries
on their satisfaction with governments. Let's `map` through each round,
select our columns of interest, filter for Spain and France, and bind
those data frames into one single tidy `tibble`.

    semi_cleaned <-
      selected_rounds %>% 
      map(~ select(.x, name, cntry, stfgov)) %>% 
      map(~ filter(.x, cntry %in% c("ES","FR"))) %>% 
      bind_rows() %>% 
      mutate(name = str_sub(name, end = 4)) %>% 
      recode_missings()

    semi_cleaned

    ## # A tibble: 26,524 x 3
    ##    name  cntry stfgov
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <dbl>
    ##  1 ESS1  ES        0.
    ##  2 ESS1  ES        0.
    ##  3 ESS1  ES        5.
    ##  4 ESS1  ES        5.
    ##  5 ESS1  ES        4.
    ##  6 ESS1  ES        7.
    ##  7 ESS1  ES        2.
    ##  8 ESS1  ES        2.
    ##  9 ESS1  ES        3.
    ## 10 ESS1  ES        3.
    ## # ... with 26,514 more rows

Now that we've got that down, let's visualize the change over time by
calculating the percentage of respondents in each category for every
year/country combination and visualize the results.

    semi_cleaned %>% 
      mutate(stfgov = case_when(stfgov <= 3 ~ "Low",
                                between(stfgov, 4, 6) ~ "Mid",
                                stfgov >= 7 ~ "High"),
             stfgov = factor(stfgov, levels = c("Low", "Mid", "High"))) %>%
      count(name, cntry, stfgov) %>% 
      group_by(name, cntry) %>% 
      mutate(perc = n / sum(n)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(name, perc, group = stfgov, colour = stfgov)) +
      geom_line() +
      theme_bw() +
      labs(x = "ESS rounds", y = "Satisfaction with Government (%)") +
      scale_colour_discrete(name = NULL) +
      facet_wrap(~ cntry)

![](/img/blog-images/2018-04-22-essurvey/spain_fr_stf-1.png)

Spain and France follow very similar patterns although the changes are
much steeper in Spain! A more elaborate analysis would perhaps be
interested in finding out if this trend line is similar in other
countries.

Downloading data for Stata, SPSS and SAS users
----------------------------------------------

To finish off, all `import_*` functions have an equivalent `download_*`
function that allows the user to save the datasets in a specified folder
in `'stata'`, `'spss'` or `'sas'` formats.

For example, to save round two from Turkey in a folder called
`./my_folder`, we use:

    download_country("Turkey", 2,
                     output_dir = "./myfolder/")

By default it saves the data as `'stata'` files. Alternatively you can
use `'spss'` or `'sas'`.

    download_country("Turkey", 2,
                     output_dir = "./myfolder/",
                     format = 'sas')

This will save the data to `./myfolder/ESS_Turkey` and inside that
folder there will be the `ESS2` folder that contains the data. The round
equivalent is `download_rounds`

Analyzing ESS data
------------------

Be aware that for analyzing data from the ESS survey you should take
into consideration the sampling and weights of the survey. The
[survey](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/) package provides
very good support for this. A useful example comes from the work of
Anthony Damico and Daniel Oberski
[here](http://asdfree.com/european-social-survey-ess.html). This example
calculated percentages manually and **appropriate statistical
inference** should consider the above.
