Want to get some hands-on insights into running an open source community? Here’s an opportunity to work with me, rOpenSci’s Community Manager, on some non-code [community-related work](/community/). I am looking for someone to work 1 day a week for 12 to 14 weeks.

Working alongside rOpenSci’s Community Manager, Stefanie Butland, you will use guidelines and checklists to help run some of our established programs like our [Blog](/blog/) and [Community Calls](/commcalls/). Tasks include:


*   Reviewing and editing community-contributed blog posts via Git and GitHub, publishing them to our [website](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2), and drafting and scheduling tweets to promote them
*   Publishing information on upcoming Community Calls to the rOpenSci website, promoting them through multiple channels, and post-Call video editing
*   Monitoring social media for use cases of rOpenSci packages or resources, encouraging people to share those in our [public forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases/), and scheduling tweets to promote them
*   Drafting and scheduling tweets when an rOpenSci package is featured in RViews Top 40, highlighted in R-Weekly monthly news, or similar digests
*   Sharing your opinions with us on how we can improve any of these

**Who are you?** You are familiar with R communities, understand that it’s _people_ that make software, and you have a sense of community building with a “what’s it like to be you” perspective. You have a working knowledge of Git and GitHub, are skilled in written and spoken communication, grammar, and editing in English and are comfortable communicating on Twitter.

**Location:** The position is remote and ideally you should be not too far from Stefanie’s Pacific timezone (UTC -8).

**Compensation** of $3,000 for 100 hours work over 12 to 14 weeks has been made available through a NumFOCUS Small Development Grant to rOpenSci.

**Want to apply?** Complete [this form](/careers/intern/) by February 3, 2020.

**Questions?** Take your time, ponder over the holidays and email stefanie@ropensci.org **after** January 2, 2020.
