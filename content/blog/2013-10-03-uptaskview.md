Just a quick note that the Task View we have been working on with others **Web Technologies and Services** is up on CRAN now. Find it here [https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html).

This is the first version - there are definitely changes to come. Changes are being suggested as I write this on Twitter...

The draft version of the task view is on Github [here](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices) if you want to [file an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/issues).

We use many packages to do stuff with the web like XML, RCurl, httr, RJSONIO, etc., and we create many packages that grab data from the web. So it made a lot of sense to work on this task view. We hope it is a good resource for everyone.
