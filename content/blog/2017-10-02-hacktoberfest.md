One of rOpenSci’s aims is to build capacity of software users and developers and foster a sense of pride in their work. What better way to do that than to encourage you to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), a month-long celebration of open source software!

### It doesn’t take much to get involved

Beginners to experts. Contributors and package maintainers welcome. You can get involved by applying the label `Hacktoberfest` to issues in your rOpenSci repo (or any project) that are ready for contributors to work on. You can find already-labelled [rOpenSci and ropenscilabs issues here](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aropensci+user%3Aropenscilabs+label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+type%3Aissue&type=). A contribution can be anything - fixing typos, improving documentation, writing tests, fixing bugs, or creating new features. Who better to improve a vignette than the person who’s using the package?!

Consider opening beginner-level issues and label them `beginner` and `Hacktoberfest`. Remember, everyone had a [first pull request](https://firstpr.me/#hadley) so put yourself in their shoes, keep our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/) in mind and help open up the doors to our community!

Have a look at this [great discussion on first-timers-only issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/47) with pointers to other discussions and resources. Please chime in in the comments below with your suggestions below for ways to help newcomers get involved.

Everyone who [signs up](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) gets stickers, but make four pull requests between October 1–31 and you get a limited edition Hacktoberfest 2017 t-shirt.
