<!---- ### Software Peer Review

[Software peer review](/software-review/) is accepting submissions again, after a pause to reduce the load on reviewers and editors in light of the COVID-19 crisis.

Consider [submitting your package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html) or [volunteering to review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html#whyreview). If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

_Have you used an rOpenSci package? [Share your use case](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) and we’ll tweet about it._

&nbsp;

<!---- ### From the Forum

_We have a discussion forum (using Discourse) for the rOpenSci community. It’s a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we’ll highlight recent discussions of interest._

* Peter Desmet asked a question that many R package maintainers run in to: [What if raw data in package is too large?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-if-raw-data-in-package-is-too-large/1955)

&nbsp;

### In the News

[Why You Should Document Your Tests](https://hynek.me/articles/document-your-tests/), by Hynek Schlawack
- [Scott](/author/scott-chamberlain/) says "I for one, only sometimes include comments in my tests, but perhaps they should be documented better?" Do you comment or document your tests? This blog post is about Python, but the ideas apply to any language.

&nbsp;

### Call For Maintainers

Part of our mission is making sustainable software users can rely on. Sometimes software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

[**rflybase**](https://docs.ropensci.org/rflybase/) is in need of a new maintainer. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
