The goal of our next Community Call is to help people recognize the breadth and depth of potential applications for rOpenSci taxonomy and biodiversity tools and to learn a bit about using them. We'd also like to learn how we might improve them.

Scott Chamberlain, developer and maintainer of many of these packages will start with an introduction and  presentation on our tools like taxize, taxizedb, rgbif, spocc. He'll be followed by Zachary Foster, rOpenSci Fellow, on the taxa and metacoder packages. Then we'll hear about use cases from Margaret Siple and Kathryn Turner. We'll have 20 minutes at the end for Q & A from the audience.

See below for information on the speakers (ANCHOR).

🕘 weekday, March 27th, 2pm PDT ([find your timezone](LINK))

☎️ Find all details for joining the call on our [Community Calls page](http://communitycalls.ropensci.org/#next-call).
Everyone is welcome. No RSVP needed.

> Have a question for the speakers?

Add yours to the [discussion thread]TOPICID. See a question you'd like to have answered? Give it a ❤️. The moderator may select some of these questions to ask during Q & A.

### What tools are we talking about?

- The Taxonomy [Task View](https://github.com/ropensci/taxonomy#taxonomy) lists some relevant packages (not exclusive to rOpenSci)
- Blog posts about the tools:
  - [rOpenSci taxonomy suite](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/07/27/taxonomy-suite/)
  - [taxize: seven years of taxonomy in R](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/05/23/taxize-seven-years/)
  - [rgbif: seven years of GBIF in R](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/08/22/rgbif-seven-years/)

### Tell us about your real-world applications

Addressing research questions involves combining multiple tools and data sources.

> Want to share **your** use case?

We've tried to make it easy for you to tell us about your applications for our taxonomy and biodiversity packages. Start a "New Topic" in the [UseCases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) in our public forum. That opens a template that suggests what information to provide, like name of the rOpenSci tool or resource you used, a link to a post or code snippet for your use case, maybe your twitter handle and a few other optional things. Maybe we'll share yours during the Call.
