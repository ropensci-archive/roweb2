The goal of our next Community Call is to help people recognize the breadth and depth of potential applications for rOpenSci tools for taxonomy and biodiversity work, learn a bit about using the tools, and for us to learn how we might improve them.

Scott Chamberlain, developer and maintainer of many of these packages will start with an introduction and  presentation on our tools like taxize, taxizedb, rgbif, spocc. He'll be followed by Zachary Foster on the taxa and metacoder packages. Then we'll hear about use cases from x y and z. We'll have 20 minutes at the end for Q&A from the audience.

🕘 weekday, March 27th, time AM PDT ([find your timezone](LINK))

☎️ Find all details for joining the call on our [Community Calls page](http://communitycalls.ropensci.org/#next-call).
Everyone is welcome. No RSVP needed.

### Agenda

1. Welcome from Stefanie Butland, rOpenSci Community Manager, (5 min)
1. Scott Chamberlain. Introduction, taxize, taxizedb, rgbif, spocc (10 min)
1. Zachary Foster. taxa, metacoder, metagenomics (10 min)
1. Margaret Siple (5 min)
1. Jasmine Lee (5 min)
1. Stacey McCormack (5 min)
1. Q & A (20 min, moderated by Scott Chamberlain)

> Have a question for the speakers?

Add yours to the [discussion thread]TOPICID. See a question you'd like to have answered? Give it a ❤️. The moderator will select some of these questions to ask during Q&A.

> Want to share **your** use case?

We've tried to make it easy for you. Start a "New Topic" in the [UseCases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) in our public forum. That opens a template that suggests what information to provide, like name of the rOpenSci tool or resource you used, a link to a blog post, and maybe your twitter handle...
