[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) is holding our annual [staff and leadership](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) meeting in Vancouver, so we’re taking the opportunity to share what we do and, if you’re interested, how you can get involved. Join us for a series of 7 short talks and demos followed by informal networking over snacks & refreshments.

rOpenSci is a non-profit initiative that promotes open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. We are creating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web, and building a welcoming and diverse global community of R users and developers from a range of research domains.
