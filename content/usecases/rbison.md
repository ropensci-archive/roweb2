title: "Macroecology - testing the species-abundance distribution"
package: rbison
gh: ropensci/rbison

Keep in mind that BISON data is at least in part within GBIF, which can
be accessed from R using our rgbif package. However, BISON provides a
slightly different interface to their data than does GBIF, and if you
are just interested in US data, then BISON may be easier to use.

In addition, this example can be done using GBIF data via `rgbif`.

In this example, we do some preliminary work in exploring
species-abundance distribution.

Make sure to update to the latest version of `rbison`

### Load libraries


```r
library("rbison")
library("ggplot2")
library("plyr")
```

### Get BISON data using the rOpenSci package rbison.

We'll not restrain our search to any particular taxonomic group,
although you will likely do that in your own research.

```r
mynames <- c("Helianthus annuus", "Pinus contorta", "Poa annua", "Madia sativa","Arctostaphylos glauca", "Heteromeles arbutifolia", "Symphoricarpos albus","Ribes viburnifolium", "Diplacus aurantiacus", "Salvia leucophylla", "Encelia californica","Ribes indecorum", "Ribes malvaceum", "Cercocarpus betuloides", "Penstemon spectabilis")
```

### Get data

Define a function to get data needed, here just the summary data, then
pull out just the *total* column and make a `data.frame` along with the
input taxon name

```r
getdata <- function(x) {
    tmp <- bison(species = x, what = "summary")$summary
    data.frame(x, abd = tmp$total)
}
```

### Get the data by passing each name to the getdata() function

```r
out <- ldply(mynames, getdata)
```

### Plot

Plot species-abundance distributions using the `radfit` function in
vegan

```r
library(vegan)
plot(radfit(out$abd))
```
