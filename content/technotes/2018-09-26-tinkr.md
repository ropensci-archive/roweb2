Remember my recent revelation that [one can wrangle (R )Markdown files
programmatically without regex](/technotes/2018/09/05/commonmark/)? In
that recent tech note, I showed how to convert (R )Markdown bodies to
XML in order to extract information from them. Now, we’ve got one step
further and are glad to present
[`tinkr`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tinkr), a package for
converting (R )Markdown files to XML, editing them, and… **writing them
back as (R )Markdown**! Read on to discover this sweet young package!

General `tinkr` workflow
------------------------

The goal of `tinkr` is to convert (R )Markdown files to XML and back to
allow their editing with `xml2` (XPath!) instead of numerous complicated
regular expressions. [If new to XPath refer to this great
intro](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp). The package
offers two functions, `to_xml` and `to_md`.

The current workflow for editing (R )md with `tinkr` is

1.  use `to_xml` to obtain XML from (R ) Markdown (*based on
    `commonmark::markdown_xml` and `blogdown:::split_yaml_body`*).

2.  edit the XML using `xml2`.

3.  use `to_md` to save back the resulting (R ) Markdown (*this uses a
    XSLT stylesheet, and [the `xslt`
    package](https://github.com/ropensci/xslt)*).

Maybe there could be shortcuts functions for some operations in 2, maybe
not.

The (R )md to XML to (R )md loop on which `tinkr` is based is slightly
lossy because of Markdown syntax redundancy. For instance

-   lists can be created with either “+”, “-” or “\*“. When using
    `tinkr`, the (R )md after editing will only use”-" for lists.

-   Links built like `[word][smallref]` and bottom `[smallref]: URL`
    become `[word](URL)`.

-   Characters are escaped (e.g. “\[” when not for a link).

-   Block quotes lines all get “&gt;” whereas in the input only the
    first could have a “&gt;” at the beginning of the first line.

-   Tables are no longer pretty, i.e. each header is followed by three
    dashes no matter the length of the longest string in the column. See
    [this
    cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables).

Such losses make your (R )md different, and the git diff a bit harder to
parse, but should *not* change the documents your (R )md is rendered to.
If it does, report a bug in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tinkr/issues)! And in any case,
as mentioned in the docs of the [`namer`
package](https://github.com/lockedata/namer), such programmatic (R
)Markdown editing is best paired with [version
control](http://happygitwithr.com/).

A solution to not loose your Markdown style, e.g. your preferring “\*"
over “-” for lists is to tweak [our XSL
stylesheet](inst/extdata/xml2md_gfm.xsl) and provide its filepath as
`stylesheet_path` argument to `to_md`.

If you want to read more technical details, head over to [that
section](#tinkr-under-the-hood). But we’ll show examples first!

A few `tinkr` examples
----------------------

The following section features a few illustrations of `tinkr` in
practice.

### Installation

Since `tinkr` is still a toddler package, it’s available from GitHub
only.

``` r
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/tinkr")
```

### Use `tinkr` to change header level

We read “example1.md”, change all headers 3 to headers 1, and save it
back to md.

``` r
# From Markdown to XML
path <- system.file("extdata", "example1.md", package = "tinkr")
(yaml_xml_list <- tinkr::to_xml(path))
```

### Use `tinkr` to wrangle chunks

Because `to_xml` parses chunk options into node attributes, one can use
`tinkr` to programmatically change options. In the example below, we set
the “echo” option to FALSE in all chunks (in real life we might prefer
deleting all echo options in chunks, and set it to FALSE in the setup
chunk).

``` r
# from Rmd to XML
path <- system.file("extdata", "example2.Rmd",
                    package = "tinkr")
yaml_xml_list <- tinkr::to_xml(path)
```

    ## Warning in stri_replace_all_regex(string, pattern,
    ## fix_replacement(replacement), : argument is not an atomic vector; coercing

``` r
library("magrittr")

# identify code blocks
body <- yaml_xml_list$body
blocks <- body %>%
xml2::xml_find_all(xpath = './/d1:code_block',
                   xml2::xml_ns(.))

# Change echo attribute
xml2::xml_set_attr(blocks, "echo", "FALSE")
blocks
```

``` r
# save back to Rmd
yaml_xml_list$body <- body
tinkr::to_md(yaml_xml_list, "newmd.Rmd")
```

### Bonus: use `tinkr::to_xml` to analyse chunk options

Even only `tinkr::to_xml` on its own can be powerful, thanks to its
parsing chunk options to node attributes. In the example below, we find
all code chunks of the [“R for data science” book by Garrett Grolemund
and Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) that have the
`error=TRUE` chunk option. It’s the option you can set to show wrong
code in your R Markdown document. Let’s find the wrong examples of that
book!

*Note that the path below is where the clone of the r4ds repo lives on
my computer.*

``` r
book_path <- "C:\\Users\\Maelle\\Documents\\ropensci\\r4ds"

rmds <- fs::dir_ls(book_path, regexp = "*.Rmd")
```

There are 32 R Markdown documents.

``` r
library("magrittr")

get_chunks <- function(xml){
  xml %>%
    xml2::xml_find_all(xpath = './/d1:code_block',
                       xml2::xml_ns(.))
}

get_error_chunks_code <- function(xml){
  xml %>%
    get_chunks()%>%
    .[xml2::xml_has_attr(., "error")] %>%
    # note that logicals are character
    .[xml2::xml_attr(., "error") == "TRUE"] %>%
    xml2::xml_text() %>%
    as.character() }

purrr::map(rmds, tinkr::to_xml) %>%
  purrr::map("body") -> bodies

bodies %>%
  purrr::map(get_chunks) -> all_chunks

length(unlist(all_chunks))
```

    ## [1] 1776

``` r
bodies %>%
  purrr::map(get_error_chunks_code) %>%
  unlist() -> buggy_code
```

There are 11 chunks to show errors out of 1776 chunks. Few enough to
show all of them (using the `results="asis"` chunk option!)…

``` r
glue::glue("```r\n {unname(buggy_code)} \n ```")
```

``` r
if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) {}

if (NA) {}
 
```

``` r
wt_mean <- function(x, w, na.rm = FALSE) {
  stopifnot(is.logical(na.rm), length(na.rm) == 1)
  stopifnot(length(x) == length(w))
  
  if (na.rm) {
    miss <- is.na(x) | is.na(w)
    x <- x[!miss]
    w <- w[!miss]
  }
  sum(w * x) / sum(w)
}
wt_mean(1:6, 6:1, na.rm = "foo")
 
```

``` r
issues %>% map_chr(c("pull_request", "html_url"))
 
```

``` r
tibble(x = "e") %>% 
  add_predictions(mod2)
 
```

``` r
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(q = quantile(mpg))
 
```

``` r
# Ok, because y and z have the same number of elements in
# every row
df1 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,           ~z,
   1, c("a", "b"), 1:2,
   2, "c",           3
)
df1
df1 %>% unnest(y, z)

# Doesn't work because y and z have different number of elements
df2 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,           ~z,
   1, "a",         1:2,  
   2, c("b", "c"),   3
)
df2
df2 %>% unnest(y, z)
 
```

``` r
tryCatch(stop("!"), error = function(e) "An error")

stop("!") %>% 
  tryCatch(error = function(e) "An error")
 
```

``` r
filter(flights, month = 1)
 
```

``` r
tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)

tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, 2))

tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, each = 2))
 
```

``` r
x[c(1, -1)]
 
```

``` r
my_variable <- 10
my_variable
 
```

Go read [the book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) to find out more about why
these chunks create error… or use `tinkr` to extract more information
out of the R Markdown source!

If you’re not interested into technical details, hop over the next
section and [read the conclusion directly](#future-plans)!

`tinkr` under the hood
----------------------

In the following I’ll give a bit more technical details about `to_xml`
and `to_md`, for those interested in such stuff, out of curiosity
(cool!) or out of a desire to become a contributor (yay!).

### From Markdown to XML: `to_xml`

The `to_xml` function uses internal code from `blogdown` to split lines
of the (R )md between YAML header and Markdown body. The Markdown body
is further processed using `commonmark::markdown_xml` with
`extensions=TRUE` and a homegrown code to transform code chunks info
from string `\`\`\`{r setup, include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}\` to XML node
attributes (called “language”, “name”, “include”, “eval” for this
example). This allows easier editing of code chunks.

*Side-note: This piece of `tinkr` worked quite well right away but we
noticed that the XML conversion lost the alignment attributes of table
cells, so I opened [an issue in the repo of the github fork of
`cmark`](https://github.com/github/cmark/issues/115). rOpenSci post-doc
hacker [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen/) helped me find where to
open this issue: `cmark` is the C library wrapped by the R package
`commonmark`. There’s the parent repo commonmark/cmark, but the one
wrapped by `commonmark` is the github/cmark fork because it’s the one
supporting GitHub-flavored Markdown extensions such as tables and
strike-through text.*

`to_xml` returns a list containing the YAML header as a character
vector, and the body as XML. YAML metadata could be edited using the
[`yaml` package](https://github.com/viking/r-yaml), which is not the
goal of `tinkr`.

### From XML to (R ) Markdown: `to_md`

After editing the XML body, one needs to convert the list containing the
YAML and the body back to (R ) Markdown. `to_md` does so by:

-   packing the chunk options back from node attributes to a string.

-   using the [rOpenSci package
    `xslt`](https://github.com/ropensci/xslt) (bindings to
    [libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/)) for conversion of the body
    to Markdown, using an XSLT stylesheet as Rosetta stone. In Jeroen’s
    words, “XSLT is just a mini programming language to run loops over
    an XML, that is written itself in XML”. Things such as
    `<heading level="2">\n  <text>R Markdown</text>\n</heading>` thus
    becomes `## R Markdown`

-   using `writeLines` on the YAML character vectors and on the body.

*Another side-note: The most crucial part here was obtaining an XSLT
stylesheet. Jeroen [opened an issue in the commonmark/cmark
repo](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark/issues/264) and [Nick
Wellnhofer](https://github.com/nwellnhof) “whipped up” an XSLT
stylesheet. If you followed correctly, the commonmark/cmark library
doesn’t support GitHub-flavoured Markdown extensions, so Nick Wellnhofer
understandably didn’t include templates for those in his stylesheet. I
miraculously was able to write a bit of XSLT myself, and [submitted a
stylesheet to the github/cmark
repo](https://github.com/github/cmark/pull/116). It imports Nick
Wellnhofer’s stylesheet, and defines templates for tables and
strike-through text.*

`to_md` exposes the path to the stylesheet as argument, so you could
provide your own in order to preserve your style preferences
(e.g. writing lists with “\*" rather than “-”)

Future plans
------------

The real goal of my creating `tinkr` was to have my Commonmark/XML
~~obsession~~ idea as a package so that I could see whether it works,
and then to go from there. Now that `to_xml` and `to_md` allow the
programmatic XML editing of (R ) Markdown files, albeit slightly lossy,
I can keep dreaming! Here are two main aspects I’d like to discuss with
you dear readers:

-   Are you an XSL wizard? If so, would you like to help me improve the
    XSLT stylesheet, in particular to prettify tables? Head to the
    GitHub repository, in particular [to this
    issue](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tinkr/issues/9), and
    volunteer!

-   `tinkr` was called after the made-up but accepted word “tink” that
    means “unknit”. `tinkr` is currently more about *tinkering with*
    than *tinking* R Markdown files, but why not unearth the common
    discussion of how to collaborate with people who’d rather edit a
    Google doc/docx than R Markdon source? Could one convert to and from
    Open Office XML and help track change for instance?

And of course, to finish on a more down-to-earth note, if you do edit (R
) Markdown files with `tinkr`, please report your experience and what
could be improved!
