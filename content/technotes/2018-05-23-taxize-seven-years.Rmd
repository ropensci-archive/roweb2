[taxize][] was seven years old this last Saturday!

## What is taxize?

`taxize` is designed around making working with taxonomic names easier - abstracting away the details of what each of 20 or so taxonomic data sources require for a given use case. 

A samping of use cases covered in `taxize` (all of these across many different data sources):

* Taxonomic identifier from a taxonomic name and vice versa
* Taxonomic name from a vernacular (common) name and vice versa
* Taxonomic hierarchy/classification from identifier or name
* Taxonomic children of an identifier or name
* All taxa downstream to a certain rank from identifier or name
* Taxonomic name synonyms from identifier or name
* Lowest common taxon and rank for an identifier or name
* Resolve taxonomic names, i.e., fix spelling errors

## History

`taxize` was one of our first packages. Our first commit was on [2011-05-19][firstcomm], uneventfully adding an empty README:

[![first_commit](/img/blog-images/2018-05-23-taxize-seven-years/taxize-first-commit.png)][firstcomm]

We've come a long way since May 2011. We've added a lot of new functionality and many new contributors.

### Commit history

Get git commits for `taxize` using a few tidyverse packages as well as [git2r](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r), our R package for working with git repositories:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(git2r)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

repo <- git2r::repository("~/github/ropensci/taxize")
res <- commits(repo)
```

A graph of commit history

```{r eval=FALSE}
dates <- vapply(res, function(z) {
    as.character(as.POSIXct(z@author@when@time, origin = "1970-01-01"))
}, character(1))
df <- tbl_df(data.frame(date = dates, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)) %>% 
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(count = n()) %>%
    mutate(cumsum = cumsum(count)) %>%
    ungroup()
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.Date(date), y = cumsum)) +
    geom_line(size = 2) +
    theme_grey(base_size = 16) +
    scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format("%Y/%m")) +
    labs(x = 'May 2011 to May 2018', y = 'Cumulative Git Commits')
```

### Contributors

A graph of new contributors through time

```{r eval=FALSE}
date_name <- lapply(res, function(z) {
    data_frame(
        date = as.character(as.POSIXct(z@author@when@time, origin = "1970-01-01")),
        name = z@author@name
    )
})
date_name <- bind_rows(date_name)

firstdates <- date_name %>%
    group_by(name) %>%
    arrange(date) %>%
    filter(rank(date, ties.method = "first") == 1) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(count = 1) %>%
    arrange(date) %>%
    mutate(cumsum = cumsum(count))

## plot

## taxize usage

Eduard Szöcs and I wrote a paper describing `taxize` back in 2013, published in F1000Research.

> Scott Chamberlain and Eduard Szöcs (2013). taxize - taxonomic search and retrieval in R. F1000Research 2:191. <https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.2-191.v1>

The paper has probably made `taxize` users more likely to cite the package, though we have no direct proof of that.

The paper above and/or the package have been cited **69** times over the past 7 years.

The way `taxize` is used in research is often in "cleaning" taxonomic names in one way or another. In addition, many users use `taxize` to get taxonomic names for certain groups of interest.

One example comes from the paper 

> Weber, M. G., Porturas, L. D., & Taylor, S. A. (2016). Foliar nectar enhances plant–mite mutualisms: the effect of leaf sugar on the control of powdery mildew by domatia-inhabiting mites. Annals of Botany, 118(3), 459–466. doi:10.1093/aob/mcw118

## Features coming down the road

* Integration with [taxa][] package (maintained by one of our rOpenSci fellows [Zachary Foster](https://github.com/zachary-foster)) in all `get_*()` functions. This will make the outputs of all `get_*()` more consistent and easier to integrate into your downstream workflows.
* not taxize per se, but [taxizedb][] is starting to really take shape due to help from [Zebulun Arendsee][zeb]. `taxizedb` will make taxonomic name work much faster for large datasets. It's worth checking out.

<br>

## Thanks!

A huge thanks goes to all `taxize` users and contributors. It's awesome to see how useful `taxize` has been through the years, and we look forward to making it even better moving forward.
