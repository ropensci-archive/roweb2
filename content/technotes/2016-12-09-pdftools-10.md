This week we released version `1.0` of the ropensci [pdftools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdftools/index.html) package to CRAN. Pdftools provides utilities for extracting text, fonts, attachments and other data from PDF files. It also supports rendering of PDF files into bitmap images.

This release has a few internal enhancements and fixes an annoying bug for landscape PDF pages. The version bump to `1.0` signifies that the package has undergone sufficient testing and the API is stable.

## Extracting Text

As described in our previous [post](/blog/2016/03/01/pdftools-and-jeroen), the most common use of `pdftools` is extracting text from (scientific) articles for searching / indexing. But let's try a somewhat more unusual PDF file this time: a poster.

```r
library(pdftools)
url <- "https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/advancedR.pdf"

# Display author, editor
pdf_info(url)
```

The `pdf_info` file returns all kind of metadata from the pdf file. For example we can read that this PDF was created on 2016-02-12 by Arianne Colton using Acrobat PDFMaker 11 for PowerPoint.

```
# extract text vector
text <- pdf_text(url)

# Print text from page 1
cat(text[1])
```

The `pdf_text` function extracts text into an R character vector if length equal to the number of pages in the PDF.
Note how the text is spaced to match the position in the PDF page.

## Rendering PDF

Recent versions of pdftools allow rendering of PDF pages into bitmap images. The `pdf_render_page` function returns the bitmap as a raw vector array of size channels * width * height (in pixels).

```r
library(pdftools)
bitmap <- pdf_render_page(url, page = 1, dpi = 72)
dim(bitmap)
### 4 1100  850
```

From here we can use for example the rOpenSci [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) package to read the bitmap and manipulate/export it to various formats.

```r
library(magick)
poster <- image_read(bitmap)
print(poster)
image_write(poster, "out.png", format = "png")
```

Or have some fun with the other magick tools :)

```r
# Download dancing banana
banana <- image_read("https://jeroen.github.io/images/banana.gif")
banana <- image_scale(banana, "300")

# Combine and flatten frames
frames <- lapply(banana, function(frame) {
  image_composite(poster, frame, offset = "+70+30")
})

# Turn frames into animation
animation <- image_animate(image_join(frames))
print(animation)

# Save as gif
image_write(animation, "output.gif")
```
