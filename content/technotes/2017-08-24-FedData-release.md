The package [`FedData`](https://github.com/ropensci/FedData) has gone through software review and is now part of [rOpenSci](/). `FedData` includes functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from several federated data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal government).

Currently, the package enables extraction from six datasets:

-   The [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](https://ned.usgs.gov) digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS)
-   The [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](https://nhd.usgs.gov) (USGS)
-   The [Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/) from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA,
NA
-   The [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, version 3, available from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), and
-   The [International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA.

`FedData` is designed with the large-scale geographic information system (GIS) use-case in mind: cases where the use of dynamic web-services is impractical due to the scale (spatial and/or temporal) of analysis. It functions primarily as a means of downloading tiled or otherwise spatially-defined datasets; additionally, it can preprocess those datasets by extracting data within an area of interest (AoI), defined spatially. It relies heavily on the [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp), [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=raster), and [`rgdal`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rgdal) packages.

## Examples

Load `FedData` and define a study area

``` r
# FedData Tester
library(FedData)
library(magrittr)

# Extract data for the Village Ecodynamics Project "VEPIIN" study area:
# http://veparchaeology.org
vepPolygon <- polygon_from_extent(raster::extent(672800, 740000, 4102000, 4170000),
                                  proj4string = "+proj=utm +datum=NAD83 +zone=12")
```

Get and plot the National Elevation Dataset for the study area

``` r
# Get the NED (USA ONLY)
# Returns a raster
NED <- get_ned(template = vepPolygon,
               label = "VEPIIN")
# Plot with raster::plot
raster::plot(NED)
```

Get and plot the Daymet dataset for the study area

``` r
# Get the DAYMET (North America only)

DAYMET <- get_daymet(template = vepPolygon,
               label = "VEPIIN",
               elements = c("prcp","tmax"),
               years = 1980:1985)
# Plot with raster::plot
raster::plot(DAYMET$tmax$X1985.10.23)
```

``` r
# Get the daily GHCN data (GLOBAL)
# Returns a list: the first element is the spatial locations of stations,
# and the second is a list of the stations and their daily data
GHCN.prcp <- get_ghcn_daily(template = vepPolygon,
                            label = "VEPIIN",
                            elements = c('prcp'))
# Plot the NED again
raster::plot(NED)
# Plot the spatial locations
sp::plot(GHCN.prcp$spatial,
         pch = 1,
         add = TRUE)
legend('bottomleft',
       pch = 1,
       legend="GHCN Precipitation Records")
```

Get and plot the daily GHCN temperature data for the study area

``` r
# Elements for which you require the same data
# (i.e., minimum and maximum temperature for the same days)
# can be standardized using standardize==T
GHCN.temp <- get_ghcn_daily(template = vepPolygon,
                            label = "VEPIIN",
                            elements = c('tmin','tmax'),
                            years = 1980:1985,
                            standardize = TRUE)
# Plot the NED again
raster::plot(NED)
# Plot the spatial locations
sp::plot(GHCN.temp$spatial,
         add = TRUE,
         pch = 1)
legend('bottomleft',
       pch = 1,

## TODO

**The current CRAN version of `FedData`, v2.4.6, will (hopefully) be the final CRAN release of `FedData` 2. `FedData` 3 will be released in the coming months, but some code built on `FedData` 2 will not be compatible with FedData 3.**

`FedData` was initially developed prior to widespread use of modern web mapping services and RESTful APIs by many Federal data-holders. Future releases of `FedData` will limit data transfer by utilizing server-side geospatial and data queries. We will also implement [`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) verbs, tidy data structures, ([`magrittr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr)) piping, functional programming using [`purrr`](https://github.com/hadley/purrr), simple features for spatial data from [`sf`](https://github.com/edzer/sfr), and local data storage in OGC-compliant data formats (probably GeoJSON and NetCDF). I am also aiming for 100% testing coverage.

All that being said, much of the functionality of the `FedData` package could be spun off into more domain-specific packages. For example, ITRDB download functions could be part of the [`dplR`](https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR/) dendrochronology package; concepts/functions having to do with the GHCN data integrated into [`rnoaa`](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa); and Daymet concepts integrated into [`daymetr`](https://github.com/khufkens/daymetr). I welcome any and all suggestions about how to improve the utility of FedData; please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/FedData/issues).
