Proper identification of individuals is crucial for acknowledging and
studying their scientific work, be it journal articles or pieces of
software. In this tech note, one year after CRAN started supporting
ORCIDs, we shall explain why and how to use unique author identifiers in
DESCRIPTION files.

Why use ORCIDs on CRAN?
-----------------------

When analyzing the authorship of CRAN packages, one can look at authors’
names and email addresses. Names can be written with and without quotes,
email addresses change, which makes it all tricky as [noted by David
Smith when he looked for the most prolific CRAN
authors](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/03/the-most-prolific-package-maintainers-on-cran.html)
(notice our very own Scott Chamberlain and Jeroen Ooms in that
scoreboard by the way?). Besides, several people can have the same name!

So all in all, using an unique ID per author makes sense. That’s
something offered for the academic world and beyond by
[ORCID](https://www.crossref.org/community/orcid/), ORCID meaning “Open
Researcher and Contributor ID”. Anyone can set up an ORCID account for
free and link it up to the rest of their online persona, as well as to
their employment and works. When the authors of a scientific paper give
their ORCID ID to the publisher, [these can be included in the html and
PDF versions of a
paper](https://orcid.org/content/journal-article-display-guidelines).
Note that there’s no, say, [Keybase verification for
ORCIDs](https://github.com/keybase/proofs/issues/126), and often the
input of an ORCID ID for a paper is declarative as well. Read more about
ORCID [here](https://orcid.org/node/8).

About one year ago, CRAN added [support for
ORCID](https://twitter.com/AchimZeileis/status/917319708713668608) in
DESCRIPTION files by [a minimally invasive
hack](https://twitter.com/AchimZeileis/status/917660536459939840). One
can add the ORCID ID of an author as a `comment` field in `person()`,
see e.g. [Carl Boettiger’s ID in `codemetar`
DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/ropensci/codemetar/blob/387456e9d62fdb9be936a089d7173e8d21d783b8/DESCRIPTION#L10),
and one gets a nice little green bubble near their name on CRAN, see
e.g. [`codemetar` CRAN
page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codemetar/index.html).

![screenshot of
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codemetar/index.html>](/img/blog-images/2018-10-08-orcid/codemetar-1.png)

The advantages of using ORCID IDs in DESCRIPTION are:

-   **Unique identifiers for free!** Sure, there’s no verification so
    someone could use your identity, but at least, it should help
    assigning your own work to you.

-   **Clickable name on CRAN pages, METACRAN pages and pkgdown
    websites!** E.g. when clicking on Carl’s green bubble on `codemetar`
    CRAN page, one gets to [his ORCID
    profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1642-628X) including a link to
    his personal website. See also [`codemetar` METACRAN
    page](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/codemetar) and [`codemetar` pkgdown
    website](https://docs.ropensci.org/codemetar/).

Even for non academics, making one’s online persona more accessible from
a CRAN DESCRIPTION can’t hurt.

How to manipulate ORCIDs in DESCRIPTION?
----------------------------------------

So, how does one add add and interact with ORCID in DESCRIPTION? Well,
thankfully, the current dev version of the RStudio [`desc`
package](https://github.com/r-lib/desc) by [Gábor
Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi) has some direct support of
ORCIDs! *Gábor too is well ranked in [the scoreboard mentioned
earlier](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/03/the-most-prolific-package-maintainers-on-cran.html)!*

``` r
remotes::install_github("r-lib/desc")
```

### Search authors by ORCID

`desc` offers many functions for manipulating authors: adding or
deleting them or their roles. Now you can perform these operations using
ORCID to identify authors to be modified. E.g. if you want to add a role
to an existing author, say Carl who worked hard enough to earn the “aut”
role, you’d run

``` r
desc::desc_add_role(role = "aut",
                    orcid = "0000-0002-1642-628X")
```

Obviously this very example above has probably little real-life
applicability, but you could imagine manipulating DESCRIPTION files *en
masse* using a table of ORCIDs and new roles.

### Add ORCID to authors of a package

The new `add_orcid()` method and `desc_add_orcid()` functions make it
possible to add ORCID IDs to authors directly instead of via the
`comment` argument. So you could write some script

``` r
desc::desc_add_orcid("0000-0002-2815-0399",
                     given = "Maëlle",
                     family = "Salmon")
```

and run it inside all your local package folders to add your ORCID. It
will add this ORCID ID to the author whose given name is “Maëlle” and
whose family name is “Salmon”. If you only write

``` r
desc::desc_add_orcid("0000-0002-2815-0399",
                     given = "Maëlle")
```

and there are two Maëlle’s, the function will error and you’ll need to
run it with more specific arguments.

### Add all of *your* identity at once!

The coolest feature of `desc` ORCID support might be that
`desc::desc_add_me()` will now use the ORCID of the environment variable
`ORCID_ID` if you created it. Hence, once per machine it’d now be
recommended to

-   install the `whoami` package necessary for `desc::desc_add_me()` to
    work. `install.packages("whoami")`.

-   create an environment variable `ORCID_ID`, editing `.Renviron` by
    calling e.g. `usethis::edit_r_environ()`. Here’s how the
    corresponding `.Renviron` line looks for me:

``` r
ORCID_ID="0000-0002-2815-0399"
```

`desc::desc_add_me()` looks for your name and email addresses in your
existing configuration (git configuration, GitHub profile), see [the
`whoami` package docs](https://github.com/r-lib/whoami). So say you’ve
just been told to add yourself as contributor of a package you’ve
improved: inside the package directory, you’d just need to run
`desc::desc_add_me()` and voilà ! No risk to wrongly copy-paste your
ORCID.

As a conclusion of this section, not only are ORCIDs useful, but they’re
getting citizen status in the world of as-automatic-as-possible package
development. Now, we shall see how one could use ORCIDs inside R to
gather information about package authors.

How to study CRAN authors via their ORCID
-----------------------------------------

As mentioned earlier, rOpenSci’s Scott Chamberlain is the [most prolific
CRAN package
maintainer](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/03/the-most-prolific-package-maintainers-on-cran.html),
so perhaps unsurprisingly, he maintains a package interacting with
ORCID’s API, [`rorcid`](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid)!

The API requires authentication so the first step after installing the
package is to run:

``` r
rorcid::orcid_auth()
```

and to save the resulting token as an `ORCID_TOKEN` environment variable
in `.Renviron` (again, `usethis::edit_r_environ()` can help with that).
Authentication warrants your having an ORCID account, so if you haven’t
one yet, [register via this link](https://orcid.org/register).

Then, we’ll query all `comment`’s of `Authors@R` of CRAN packages. Some
CRAN packages use the `Author` field instead, which is not recommended
and doesn’t allow using `comment`.

*Side-note, in general, how would one analyze stuff over the whole CRAN
collection?*

-   *Some information can be found in `tools::CRAN_package_db()` as seen
    in [this recent tech
    note](/technotes/2018/09/10/github-badges/).*

-   *There’s [an official read-only mirror of each all CRAN packages on
    GitHub](https://github.com/cran) thanks to METACRAN.*

-   *METACRAN serves a [CRAN package
    database](https://r-pkg.org/services#crandb), wrapped by an R
    package of course.*

-   *One could try setting up a local CRAN mirror.*

Thanks to Gábor, who maintains METACRAN, for patiently answering my
questions about meta-CRAN things. If we were after the comments section
of just a few packages, we could query METACRAN database like so:

``` r
url <- "https://crandb.r-pkg.org/-/latest?keys=[%22desc%22,%22codemetar%22]"
obj  <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url, simplifyVector = FALSE)
lapply(obj, function(x) eval(parse(text = x$`Authors@R`))$comment)
```

but in our case, when wanting to get all the current CRAN authors, it’s
easier to use `tools::CRAN_package_db()`. As a side-note, if you find a
better solution than the functions defined below `parse_authors()` and
`parse_author()` (some `purrr` magic?) to coerce all authors information
to a `data.frame`, feel free to comment under the post!

``` r
library("magrittr")
all_info <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
all_info <- all_info[!is.na(all_info$`Authors@R`),]
all_info <- all_info[, c("Package", "Authors@R")]
names(all_info)[2] <- "authors_at_r"

null_to_na <- function(x){
  if(is.null(x)){
    NA
  }else{
    x
  }
}

parse_author <- function(author){
  author <- as.person(author)
  tibble::tibble(given = null_to_na(author$given),
                 family = null_to_na(author$family),
                 email = null_to_na(author$email),
                 comment = as.character(null_to_na(author$comment)),
                 orcid = as.character(null_to_na(author$comment["ORCID"])))
}

parse_authors <- function(authors_at_r){
  authors <- try(eval(parse(text = authors_at_r)),
                silent = TRUE)
  if(inherits(authors, "try-error")){
    return(list(NA))
  }
  
  else{
    list(purrr::map_dfr(authors, parse_author))
  }
  
}

cran_authors <- all_info %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::select(Package, authors_at_r) %>% 
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(authors = parse_authors(authors_at_r)) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(authors)
```

This is how the resulting table looks like. Out of 13147 packages on
CRAN we are looking at 5421, i.e. packages using the `Authors@R` field.
There is one line per author in a package.

``` r
str(cran_authors)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    16272 obs. of  7 variables:
    ##  $ Package     : chr  "abbyyR" "abc" "abc" "abc" ...
    ##  $ authors_at_r: chr  "person(\"Gaurav\", \"Sood\", email = \"gsood07@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))" "c( \n    person(\"Csillery\", \"Katalin\", role = \"aut\", email=\"kati.csillery@gmail.com\"),\n    person(\"Le"| __truncated__ "c( \n    person(\"Csillery\", \"Katalin\", role = \"aut\", email=\"kati.csillery@gmail.com\"),\n    person(\"Le"| __truncated__ "c( \n    person(\"Csillery\", \"Katalin\", role = \"aut\", email=\"kati.csillery@gmail.com\"),\n    person(\"Le"| __truncated__ ...
    ##  $ given       : chr  "Gaurav" "Csillery" "Lemaire" "Francois" ...
    ##  $ family      : chr  "Sood" "Katalin" "Louisiane" "Olivier" ...
    ##  $ email       : chr  "gsood07@gmail.com" "kati.csillery@gmail.com" NA NA ...
    ##  $ comment     : chr  NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ orcid       : chr  NA NA NA NA ...

We can count the number of occurrences of ORCIDs.

``` r
(cran_authors %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(orcid)) %>%
  dplyr::pull(Package) %>%
  unique() %>%
  length() -> orcid_pkg_no)
```

    ## [1] 613

Only 613 packages have at least an ORCID ID out of 13147 CRAN packages
(you can’t have an ORCID ID without using the `Authors@R` field).

There are 512 unique ORCID IDs. Let’s look at the most prolific authors
with an ORCID ID.

``` r
cran_authors %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(orcid)) %>%
  dplyr::count(orcid, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(n = 10) -> most_prolific
```

``` r
knitr::kable(most_prolific)
```

| orcid               |    n|
|:--------------------|----:|
| 0000-0003-1444-9135 |   29|
| 0000-0002-4035-0289 |   21|
| 0000-0003-0918-3766 |   21|
| 0000-0003-4198-9911 |   19|
| 0000-0003-4097-6326 |   16|
| 0000-0001-8301-0471 |   13|
| 0000-0003-0645-5666 |   12|
| 0000-0001-5243-233X |   11|
| 0000-0001-5670-2640 |   11|
| 0000-0002-8584-459X |   10|

Then we can use `rorcid` to get a glimpse of their profile.

``` r
rorcid::as.orcid(most_prolific$orcid)

Interestingly we recognize some names from the most prolific CRAN
maintainers (Scott and Jeroen, again!) but not only. Note that another
difference with [David Smith’s
post](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/03/the-most-prolific-package-maintainers-on-cran.html)
is that the list above includes authors no matter their role.

Over all authors with an ORCID, using `rorcid` one could extract their
location and much more, but this is beyond the scope of this tech note.

Inversely, if one wanted to find CRAN packages by ORCID ID, instead of
ORCID IDs by CRAN package, one could make the most of METACRAN. There is
no search by ORCID, but since everything in DESCRIPTION is indexed by
METACRAN, one can use the ORCID ID as search term. Say you want to find
all packages by Scott Chamberlain:

-   You can use this URL
    <https://r-pkg.org/search.html?q=0000-0003-1444-9135>

-   Or this to get an API (and further parse the JSON in R?)
    <http://seer.r-pkg.org:9200/cran-devel/package/_search?q=%220000-0003-1444-9135%22>

-   Other methods to search CRAN by ORCID ID might include [using the
    `seer` package (not possible
    yet)](https://github.com/metacran/seer/issues/11).

Conclusion
----------

In this tech note we made the case for using ORCID IDs as identifiers
for the authors of CRAN packages, for academics and non-academics as
well. We described the current [`desc`](https://github.com/r-lib/desc)
support for ORCID. We also gave a small insight into the wealth of
information one can get via
[`rorcid`](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid).

For academics, another aspect of making their software contributions
valuable is getting the software they write as work inside their ORCID
profile. One can do that by hand, but one can also

-   get a legit DOI for each package release by activating
    [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for the repository,

-   write a software paper, e.g. via [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/),
    that’d have its own DOI.

But this is probably a topic for another time, such as would be the
topic of CRAN potentially adopting other IDs like GitHub username,
ideally via Keybase. By the way if you’d like to see a Keybase
integration of ORCID happen, please “+1” [this issue by Steph
Locke](https://github.com/keybase/proofs/issues/126). In the meantime,
let’s hope ORCID IDs will be more adopted by academics and non-academics
alike for:

-   Making CRAN package authors easier to identify and their online
    persona easier to find.

-   Making academic CRAN package authors’ scientific contributions
    easier to access when studying packages.
