Version 7.0.0 of [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) just arrived on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), and it is faster and easier to use than previous releases.


```r
install.packages("drake")
```

## Recap

Data analysis can be slow. A round of scientific computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. After it finishes, if you update your code or data, your hard-earned results may no longer be valid. How much of that valuable output can you keep, and how much do you need to update? How much runtime must you endure all over again?

For projects in R, the workflow package [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) can help. It [analyzes your project](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html), skips steps with up-to-date results, and orchestrates the rest with [optional distributed computing](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html). At the end, [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) provides evidence that your results match the underlying code and data, which increases your ability to trust your research.

Other [pipeline tools](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline) such as [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make), [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake/wiki/Home), [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), and [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) accomplish similar goals, but [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is uniquely suited to R. It features

- A focus on ordinary R functions and variables rather than cumbersome files.
- Heavy use of the data frame, even as a substitute for the  traditional [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make).
- Native [tidy evaluation](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org) support.
- A new [domain-specific language (DSL)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/dsl.html) for [creating large workflows](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html#large-plans).

## Plans

[`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s [DSL](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/dsl.html) is still experimental, but it is more powerful than old interface functions such as [`evaluate_plan()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/). [A new section of the manual](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html#large-plans) walks through the details, and the revised [gross state product example](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/gsp.html) is a motivating use case.

Three **transformations** form the core of the new syntax.

| Transformation | Tidyverse equivalent        |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `map()`        | `pmap()` from `purrr`       |
| `cross()`      | `crossing()` from `tidyr`   |
| `combine()`    | `summarize()` from `dplyr`  |

These transformations help declare batches of multiple targets.


```r
library(drake)

# short names to tell get_data() what to download:
source <- c("census", "gapminder")

plan <- drake_plan(
  data = target(
    get_data(from), # custom function
    transform = map(from = !!source, .id = FALSE)
  ),
  run = target(
    analysis_function(data),
    transform = cross(data, analysis_function = c(lda, rf))
  ),
  out = target(
    my_summaries(run),
    transform = combine(run, .by = analysis_function)
  )
)

plan
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2
#>   target         command                                   
#>   <chr>          <expr>                                    
#> 1 data           get_data("census")                        
#> 2 data_2         get_data("gapminder")                     
#> 3 run_lda_data   lda(data)                                 
#> 4 run_rf_data    rf(data)                                  
#> 5 run_lda_data_2 lda(data_2)                               
#> 6 run_rf_data_2  rf(data_2)                                
#> 7 out_lda        my_summaries(run_lda_data, run_lda_data_2)
#> 8 out_rf         my_summaries(run_rf_data, run_rf_data_2)
```

Above, note the `<expr>` label underneath the `command` header. For the sake of faster and cleaner metaprogramming, `plan$command` is now a list of [expressions](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Expressions.html) by default. (However, you can still supply a character vector if you wish.)

## Performance

After [serious profiling and benchmarking](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/overhead), [`make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/make.html) and [`drake_config()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/drake_config.html) are substantially faster in workflows with thousands of targets. The changes affect [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s internal [storage](https://github.com/richfitz/storr) protocol, so targets built with previous versions are not up to date anymore, but [`make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/make.html) pauses to let you downgrade to an earlier version or start from scratch.

In addition, to increase clarity and ease of use, the `parallelism` argument of [`make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/make.html) has fewer choices. Of the previous 11 options, only the best 3 remain. See the updated [high-performance computing guide](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html) for details.

| `parallelism` | Functionality         |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| `"loop"`      | No parallel computing |
| `"clustermq"` | [Persistent workers](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html#persistent-workers)    |
| `"future"`    | [Transient workers](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html#transient-workers)     |

## Reproducibility

By default, [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) watches your session and environment for dependencies. This behavior frees [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) to fully focus on R, enhancing interactivity, flexibility, and independence from cumbersome configuration files. However, a fully reproducible use of [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) requires care. Version 7.0.0 comes with new workarounds and safeguards.

### Interactive sessions

A serious [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow should be consistent and reliable, ideally with the help of a [master R script](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/blob/master/gsp/make.R). Before it builds your targets, this script should begin in a fresh R session and load your packages and functions in a [dependable manner](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/blob/d9417547a05aec416afbbda913eaf2d44a552d5b/gsp/make.R#L4-L6). [Batch mode](https://www.statmethods.net/interface/batch.html) helps ensure all this goes according to plan. If you use a single persistent [interactive R session](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/interactive.html) to repeatedly invoke `make()` while you develop the workflow, then over time, your session could grow stale and accidentally invalidate targets.

To combine interactivity with reproducibility, version 7.0.0 has a new experimental [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr)-like interface. Functions such as [`r_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/r_make.html), [`r_outdated()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/r_make.html), and [`r_drake_graph_info()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/r_make.html) each run [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) in a transient [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) session so that accidental changes to your interactive session do not break your results.

For more information, please see the newly refreshed [chapter on `drake` projects](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/projects.html#safer-interactivity). For example code, you can download the updated [main example](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/main) (`drake_example("main")`) and experiment with files [`_drake.R`](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/blob/master/main/_drake.R) and [`interactive.R`](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/blob/master/main/interactive.R).

### Self-invalidation

An additional safeguard prevents workflows from invalidating themselves.


```r
plan <- drake_plan(
  x = {
    data(mtcars)
    mtcars$mpg
  },
  y = mean(x)
)

plan
#> # A tibble: 2 x 2
#>   target command                            
#>   <chr>  <expr>                             
#> 1 x      {     data(mtcars)     mtcars$mpg }
#> 2 y      mean(x)

make(plan)
#> target x
#> fail x
#> Error: Target `x` failed. Call `diagnose(x)` for details. Error message:
#>   cannot add bindings to a locked environment. 
#> Please read the "Self-invalidation" section of the make() help file.
```

The error above comes from the call to `data(mtcars)`. Without guardrails, the very act of building `x` changes `x`'s dependencies. In other words, `x` is still invalid after [`make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/make.html) completes.


```r
make(plan, lock_envir = FALSE)
#> target x
#> target y

make(plan, lock_envir = FALSE)
#> target x
```

There are [legitimate use cases](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/675#issuecomment-458222414) for `lock_envir = FALSE`, but most projects should stick with the default `lock_envir = TRUE`.

### Remarks

[`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) enhances reproducibility, but not in all respects. [Literate programming](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), [local library managers](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat), [containerization](https://www.docker.com), and [strict session managers](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) offer more robust solutions in their respective domains. Reproducibility encompasses a [wide variety of tools and techniques](https://github.com/karthik/rstudio2019) working together.

## Thanks
