A new version of the ropensci [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magick) package has been released to CRAN. Magick is a package for Advanced Image-Processing in R. It wraps the ImageMagick STL which is perhaps the most comprehensive open-source image processing library available today. Our [original announcement](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/08/23/z-magick-release) has more details.

## New features

This new version now includes a beautiful [vignette](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) which gives an overview of the main functionality to get you started! It lists the various formats, transformations, effects, operations and much more.

The vignette also explains how to use magick with [raster graphics](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html#raster_graphics). This new functionality makes it possible to overlay images on R's graphics device.

## Installing and Updating

The package is most easily installed from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("magick")
```

When installing from source make sure the Magick++ library is available on your system.
