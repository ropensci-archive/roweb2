A few weeks ago we [announced](/blog/2016/11/16/tesseract) the first release of the [tesseract](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/index.html) package: a high quality OCR engine in R. We have now released an update with extra features.

## Installing Training Data

As explained in the [first post](/blog/2016/11/16/tesseract), the tesseract system is powered by language specific training data. By default only English training data is installed. [Version 1.3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/index.html) adds utilities to make it easier to install additional training data.

```r
# Download French training data
tesseract_download("fra")
```

Note that this function is not needed on Linux. Here you should install training data via your system package manager instead. For example on Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-fra
```

And on Fedora/CentOS you use:

```sh
sudo yum install tesseract-langpack-fra
```

Use `tesseract_info()` to see which training data are currently installed.

## OCR Engine Parameters

Tesseract supports many [parameters](http://www.sk-spell.sk.cx/tesseract-ocr-parameters-in-302-version) to fine tune the OCR engine. For example you can limit the possible characters that can be recognized.

```r
engine <- tesseract(options = list(tessedit_char_whitelist = "0123456789"))
ocr("image.png", engine = engine)
```

In the example above, Tesseract will only consider numeric characters. If you know in advance the data is numeric (for example an accounting spreadsheet) such options can tremendously improve the accuracy.


## Magick Images

Tesseract now automatically recognizes images from the awesome [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/index.html) package (our [R wrapper to ImageMagick](/blog/2016/08/23/z-magick-release)). This can be useful to preprocess images before feeding to tesseract.

```r
library(magick)
library(tesseract)
image <- image_read("http://jeroen.github.io/files/dog_hq.png")
image <- image_crop(image, "1700x100+50+150")
cat(ocr(image))
```

We plan to more integration between Magick and Tesseract in future versions.
