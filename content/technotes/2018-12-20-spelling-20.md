We have released updates for the rOpenSci text analysis tools. This technote will highlight some of the major improvements in the [spelling](https://github.com/ropensci/spelling#readme) package and also the underlying [hunspell](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/hunspell/vignettes/intro.html) package, which provides the spelling engine for the spelling package.

```r
install.packages("spelling")
```

Update to the latest versions to use these cool new features!

## Automatic Checking of README and NEWS files


Users that are already using _spelling_ on their packages might discover a few new typos! The new version of spelling now also checks the `readme.md` and `news.md` and `index.md` files in your package root directory. 

```r
spelling::spell_check_package()
#   WORD       FOUND IN
# AppVeyor   README.md:5
# CMD        description:3
#            README.md:12
# devtools   README.md:93
# hunspell   spell_check_files.Rd:18,32
#            spell_check_package.Rd:24
#            README.md:31
```

Of course it also still checks your manual pages, vignettes and description fields. Hence we now spell check all content that is used to generate your package website with pkgdown.


## Improved Markdown Parsing

Parsing of markdown files in `spell_check_files()` and `spell_check_package()` has been tweaked in a few places, resulting in less false positives.

First of all, it now properly parses the yaml front-matter and only runs the spell check only on the `title`, `subtitle` and `description` fields. The other fields usually contain code or options, not actual language we want to check.

```r
spelling::spell_check_files("README.md")
#   WORD       FOUND IN
# AppVeyor   README.md:5
# CMD        README.md:12
# devtools   README.md:93
# hunspell   README.md:31
# readme     README.md:37
# RStudio    README.md:8,93
# wordlist   README.md:12
```


Also the parser now filters words that contain __@__ symbol. Such a word is usually a [rmarkdown citation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) or twitter handle, or email address, neither of which should be spell checked.

Finally all markdown files are now treated as UTF-8 which should fix a problem that Windows users may have been seeing when checking files that contain non-ascii text, such as words with [diacritics](https://github.com/ropensci/spelling/issues/17) or basically anything that is not in Latin script. Which brings us to the next topic...


## Support for RStudio Dictionaries

The spelling and hunspell packages require a dictionary for spell checking text in a given language. By default we include `en-US` and `en-GB`, but installing additional dictionaries has become even easier. The package will now automatically find dictionaries that you have installed in RStudio:

[![screenshot](https://jeroen.github.io/images/rs-hunspell.png)](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/hunspell/vignettes/intro.html#hunspell_dictionaries)

The RStudio IDE has a menu to install additional languages `(Global Options -> Spelling -> Main Dictionary Language -> Install)`. The installed dictionaries will automatically become available to hunspell and you can use them in all hunspell/spelling functions that take a `lang` or `dict` argument.

```r
hunspell::list_dictionaries()
#  [1] "bg_BG"     "ca_ES"     "cs_CZ"     "da_DK"     "de_DE_neu" "de_DE"     "el_GR"    
#  [8] "en_AU"     "en_CA"     "en_GB"     "en_US"     "es_ES"     "fr_FR"     "hr_HR"    
# [15] "hu-HU"     "id_ID"     "it_IT"     "lt_LT"     "lv_LV"     "nb_NO"     "nl_NL"    
# [22] "pl_PL"     "pt_BR"     "pt_PT"     "ro_RO"     "ru_RU"     "sh"        "sk_SK"    
# [29] "sl_SI"     "sr"        "sv_SE"     "uk_UA"     "vi_VN"

hunspell::hunspell("Nou breekt mijn klomp!", dict = 'nl_NL')
# character(0)
```

Not using RStudio? The last chapter of the [hunspell vignette](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/hunspell/vignettes/intro.html#hunspell_dictionaries) explains in detail how to install dictionaries on different platforms.


## Low Level Hunspell Updates

Text analysis experts might notice some significant improvements in hunspell because it includes the latest [libhunspell 1.7](https://github.com/explore) library. This version has lots of new features and bug fixes by László Németh. 

Among the changes are performance enhancements and tweaks in the suggestion algorithm, i.e. the `hunspell::hunspell_suggest()` function in R. For a complete overview of changes have a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/blob/master/NEWS) from libhunspell. 

Also we have updates the `en-US` and `en-GB` dictionaries included with the hunspell package to the latest version `2018.11.01` from [libreoffice](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/english-dictionaries/2018-11.01). This update include many new words that may have been previously marked as spelling errors.
