"Continuous Integration" (CI) has become a standard for proper software development.
Checking the integrity of software after changes have been made is essential to ensure its proper functionality.
Also, CI helps catching problems introduced by dependencies early when executed on a regular basis (usually done via scheduled runs via CRON jobs).

Multiple professional providers exist (Travis CI, Appveyor CI, Circle CI, etc.) which offer CI services to the public.
Most services offer limited free build contingents for open-source projects.
However, it has not been easy for the R community to jump on the train right away as most providers did not support the language from their side.
Therefore, the R community started to create their own configurations to quickly automate the checking of R packages on Travis CI.
In fact, the first commit of the official `r.rb` build script was made on [Feb 1st 2015 by Craig Citro](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/commit/c697bb2240cfc1abb92a95f57d2e72c151104431#diff-5b7e1aa01f1c6f058df6e0b9e2486c62).
Since then 21 unique contributors maintained this configuration under the meta-lead of [Jim Hester](https://github.com/jimhester) and [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen) and many thousand R package maintainers jumped onto the train.

However, Travis CI has it limits and therefore people started to try out other providers such as Appveyor CI or Circle CI.
Besides having to start from scratch, all providers come with their own YAML keys and ways to set up deployment permissions.

With the aim to simplify these processes for users, the {tic} package was created.
It is aimed to provide a CI-agnostic way to check R packages.
But not just R packages! 
It also aims to simplify the creation of blogs, websites, drat repos and other things related to CI activities.

By providing CI YAML templates which forward their actions to a centralized Rscript (`tic.R`), the same setup will trigger identical actions on different CI systems.
The user does not need to worry about setting up the YAML file for a specific provider but just get familiarized with the "macro" approach of {tic}.
Macros are sequences of steps for popular actions often requested by people in the R community for R related projects.

Furthermore {tic} aims to simplify the tedious process of setting up deployment permissions for a repo.
("Deployment" means that a CI run is allowed to perform a `git` push to the repository.)
This is achieved by its helper packages such as {circle}, {ghactions} or {travis} which perform API calls to the respective CI providers.
