A bit more than one year ago, rOpenSci [launched its new website design](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci/status/925036483383148545), by the designer [Maru Lango](https://www.marulango.com/). Not only did the website appearance change (for the best!), but the underlying framework too. ropensci.org is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), like `blogdown`! Over the last few months, we've made the best of this framework, hopefully improving your browsing experience (and trapping you into binge reading). In this note, we'll go over the main developments, as well as give some Hugo tips. 

# Our website and its source

Skip this section if you just want to know what's become better on our website!

Our website is located at [ropensci.org]. Its source lives on GitHub in [the ropensci/roweb2 repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/). The website is deployed on Netlify from the master branch, and each pull request gets a Netlify preview link too, which is quite handy when reviewing new blog posts.

Nearly all the changes mentioned in this post were made to the _theme_ of our website which you can find [at this folder of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/themes/ropensci/layouts). When modifying Hugo templates, reading Hugo docs is very helpful. When things go wrong (why doesn't this partial know about the author list?!) head to the [debugging template docs](https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/). And if you can't figure out a way out, Hugo has got a [Discourse forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) like [all the cool kids these days](https://discuss.ropensci.org/).

Other changes were adjustments to content such as YAML reformatting. Fear not, we rarely had to manually update metadata, we wrote scripts using the [`yaml` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaml/index.html).

# More entry points to content

On top of a few general pages, our website is the home of many [blog posts](/blog), [tech notes](/technotes) and [community calls](/commcalls). We've created and improved pages referencing content over all these categories, so that you might more easily bounce [from say one software review post to the next](/tags/software-review), read [all posts by our community manager](/authors/stefanie-butland), or simply find [all the things we ever published](/archive).

## Tags and authors pages

We now have a [tags page](/tags) referencing all tags along with the number of posts associated to them. The tags of a blog post, tech note or comm call are shown at the bottom, so that after reading you can choose to check out more content on the topic.

Technically, getting tags and authors page and tag pages is quite straightforward with Hugo thanks to _taxonomies_. To switch them on, we added these lines to the website config.toml

```
[taxonomies]
  tag = "tags"
  author = "authors"
```

For authors, a challenge was moving metadata around, from storing authors' metadata inside posts metadata to having authors metadata files under content/authors, but as mentioned earlier, with the `yaml` package you can edit hundreds of Markdown files at once, just check the edits carefully.

Read more about [Hugo taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/), how to write [templates for taxonomy pages](https://gohugo.io/templates/taxonomy-templates/) and [where to save them so Hugo finds them](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/#examples-layout-lookup-for-taxonomy-list-pages). In our case, the tags and authors pages have different templates: [tags page](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/_default/terms.html), [tag pages](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/taxonomy/tag.html), [authors templates](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/authors)

## Archive
 

And should you ever get lost, we've now a [cool 404 page](/404), although mentioning it probably lessens its coolness.
