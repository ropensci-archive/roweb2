A bit more than one year ago, rOpenSci [launched its new website design](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci/status/925036483383148545), by the designer [Maru Lango](https://www.marulango.com/). Not only did the website appearance change (for the best!), but the underlying framework too. ropensci.org is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), like `blogdown`! Over the last few months, we've made the best of this framework, hopefully improving your browsing experience (and trapping you into binge reading). In this note, we'll go over the main developments, as well as give some Hugo tips. 

# Our website and its source

Skip this section if you just want to know what's become better on our website!

Our website is located at [ropensci.org]. Its source lives on GitHub in [the ropensci/roweb2 repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/). The website is deployed on Netlify from the master branch, and each pull request gets a Netlify preview link too, which is quite handy when reviewing new blog posts.

Nearly all the changes mentioned in this post were made to the _theme_ of our website which you can find [at this folder of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/themes/ropensci/layouts). Other changes were adjustments to content such as YAML reformatting. Fear not, we rarely had to manually update metadata, we wrote scripts using the [`yaml` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaml/index.html)

# More entry points to content

And should you ever get lost, we've now a [cool 404 page](/404), although mentioning it probably lessens its coolness.

# More content

# A nicer appearance on Twitter

# A calendar automatically up-to-date



# Behind-the-scene details
