A new version of [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) package to CRAN. This is a maintenance release with enhancements and bug fixes. A summary of changes in v1.2 from the [NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/NEWS) file:


  - Add `read_json` and `write_json` convenience wrappers, [#161](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/issues/161)
  - Update `modp_numtoa` from upstream, fixes a rounding issue in [#148](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/issues/148).
  - Ensure `asJSON.POSIXt` does not use sci notation for negative values, [#155](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/issues/155)
  - Tweak `num_to_char` to properly print large negative numbers
  - Performance optimization for simplyfing data frames (see below)

Use the *Github compare* page to see the full diff on [metacran](https://github.com/cran/jsonlite/compare/1.1...1.2).

## New read/write API

The package has gained new high level functions `read_json` and `write_json`. These are [wrappers](https://github.com/cran/jsonlite/blob/1.2/R/read_json.R#L18-L29) for `fromJSON` and `toJSON` which read/write json directly from/to disk. This API is consistent with tidyverse packages like readr, readxl and haven (see [#161](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/issues/161)).

The only thing to note is that `read_json` does not simplify by default, as is done by `fromJSON`. For example:


```r
# Write Data frame to a temp file
tmp <- tempfile()
write_json(iris, tmp)

# Nested lists
read_json(tmp)

# A data frame
read_json(tmp, simplifyVector = TRUE)
```

Notice how `read_json` only returns a data frame when `simplifyVector` is explicitly set to `TRUE`.


## Performance enhancements

We have ported a bit of C code to optimize simplification for data frame structures. This script compares performance for both versions:

```r
# example json
json <- jsonlite::toJSON(ggplot2::diamonds)

# Test with jsonlite 1.1
devtools::install_github("cran/jsonlite@1.1")
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(jsonlite::fromJSON(json), times = 50)

# Unload jsonlite 1.1 (might need restart R on windows)
unloadNamespace("jsonlite")
library.dynam.unload('jsonlite', find.package('jsonlite'))

# Test with jsonlite 1.2
devtools::install_github("cran/jsonlite@1.2")
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(jsonlite::fromJSON(json), times = 50)
```

On my Macbook this has reduced the median time from approx 0.91s to 0.76s.
