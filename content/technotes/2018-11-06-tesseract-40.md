Last week Google and friends released the new major version of their OCR system: [Tesseract 4](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases). This release builds upon 2+ years of hard work and has completely overhauled the internal OCR engine. From the [tesseract wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00):

> Tesseract 4.0 includes a new neural network-based recognition engine that delivers significantly higher accuracy (on document images) than the previous versions, in return for a significant increase in required compute power. On complex languages however, it may actually be faster than base Tesseract.

We have now also updated the R package [tesseract](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/index.html) to ship with the new Tesseract 4 on MacOS and Windows. It uses the new engine by default, and the results are extremely impressive! Recognition is much more accurate then before, even without manually enhancing the image quality.

## Updating

The binary R package for Windows and MacOS can be installed directly from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("tesseract")
```

Tesseract 4 uses a new training data format, so if you had previously installed custom training data you might need to redownload these as well:

```r
# If you want to OCR french text:
library(tesseract)
tesseract_download('fra')
```

Training data for `eng` (default) is included with the R package already.

## Testing

Let's take a simple example from last month's [blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/28/birds-ocr/) about ocr'ing bird drawings from the natural history collection. We use the magick package to preprocess the image (crop the area of interest). The `image_ocr()` function is a magick wrapper for `tesseract::ocr()`.

![birds](https://jeroen.github.io/images/birds.jpg)


```r
library(magick)
image_read("https://jeroen.github.io/images/birds.jpg") %>%
  image_crop('1200x300+100+1700') %>%
  image_ocr() %>%
  cat()
```

```

```


Tesseract has perfectly detected the hand-written species name (both the Latin and English name), and has also found and nearly perfectly predicted the tiny author names. These results would be a very good basis for post-processing and automatic classification. For example we could match these results against known species and authors as illustrated explained in the original [blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/28/birds-ocr/).
