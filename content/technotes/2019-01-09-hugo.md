A bit more than one year ago, rOpenSci [launched its new website design](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci/status/925036483383148545), by the designer [Maru Lango](https://www.marulango.com/). Not only did the website appearance change (for the better!), but the underlying framework too. [ropensci.org](https://ropensci.org) is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), like [`blogdown`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown)! Over the last few months, we've made the best of this framework, hopefully improving your browsing experience (and trapping you into binge reading). In this note, we'll go over the main developments, as well as give some Hugo tips. 

## Our website and its source

Skip this section if you just want to know what's become better on our website!

Our website is located at [ropensci.org](https://ropensci.org). Its source lives on GitHub in [the ropensci/roweb2 repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/). The website is built on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) from the master branch, and each pull request gets a Netlify preview link too, which is quite handy when reviewing new blog posts.

Nearly all the changes mentioned in this post were made to the _theme_ of our website which you can find [at this folder of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/themes/ropensci/layouts). When modifying Hugo templates, [reading Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) is very helpful. When things go wrong (why doesn't this partial know about the author list?!) head to the [debugging template docs](https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/). And if you can't figure out a way out, Hugo has got a [Discourse forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) like [all the cool kids these days](https://discuss.ropensci.org/). Needless to say, another useful tip when learning Hugo templating is to start small, with either a minimal theme and tiny website, or small updates, then your skills will improve.

Other changes were adjustments to content such as YAML reformatting. Fear not, we rarely had to manually update metadata, we wrote scripts using the [`yaml` R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=yaml). Find [such a script](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/issues/197#issuecomment-394264824).

## More entry points to content

On top of a few general pages, our website is the home of many [blog posts](/blog), [tech notes](/technotes) and [community calls](/commcalls). We've created and improved pages referencing content over all these categories, so that you might more easily bounce [from say one software peer review post to the next](/tags/software-peer-review), read [all posts by our community manager](/authors/stefanie-butland), or simply find [all the things we ever published](/archive).

### Tags and authors pages

We now have a [tags page](/tags) referencing all tags along with the number of posts associated to them. The tags of a blog post, tech note or community call are shown at the bottom, so that after reading you can choose to check out more content on the topic. After tags became even more valuable, to make the process of adding or editing them smoother, we've created a [Shiny app to update tags more easily over many posts, `blogyaml`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/blogyaml). It's worked well for us, and if you notice something wrong, well it has an issue tracker!

We also have added an [authors page](/authors) that's very similar to the tags page. On each author's page, you'll find their title for rOpenSci staff members, their online home, possibly their Twitter handle, and all the content they've authored on our website. [See for instance Stefanie Butland's author page](authors/stefanie-butland). These pages are linked from authors' names. Thanks to [Angela Li](https://angela-li.github.io/) for [suggesting we add authors pages](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/issues/365).

Technically, getting tags and authors page and tag pages is quite straightforward with Hugo thanks to _taxonomies_. To switch them on, we added these lines to the website config.toml

```
[taxonomies]
  tag = "tags"
  author = "authors"
```

We added this option as well

```
preserveTaxonomyNames = true
```

to not mess up with authors' names capitalization when listing them.

For authors, a challenge was moving metadata around, from storing authors' metadata (online home, Twitter username) inside posts metadata to having authors metadata files under content/authors, see [this example](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/authors/ignasi-bartomeus/_index.md), but as mentioned earlier, with the `yaml` package you can edit hundreds of Markdown files at once, granted you check the edits carefully. We found [this guidance about authors page](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/24/hugo-tips-how-to-create-author-pages/) very thorough.

Read more about [Hugo taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/), how to write [templates for taxonomy pages](https://gohugo.io/templates/taxonomy-templates/) and [where to save them so Hugo finds them](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/#examples-layout-lookup-for-taxonomy-list-pages). In our case, the tags and authors pages have different templates: [tags page](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/_default/terms.html), [tag pages](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/taxonomy/tag.html), [authors templates](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/authors)

### Archive

With precious content scattered over three categories (blog, tech notes, community calls), getting an overview can be tricky hence our adding an [archive page](/archive) featuring all our website content [from our very first blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2012/11/26/is-invasive/). Behind the scenes, we [list pages with a date](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/_default/single.html#L29) and [feeds them to an archive partial](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/partials/archive.html) that we use for the [technotes page](/technotes) and authors pages as well for consistent presentation.

And should you ever get lost, we've now got a [cool 404 page](/404), although mentioning it probably lessens its coolness. [Here is its source](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/404.html).

## More content

In the previous section we mention the [community calls living in ropensci.org](/commcalls). They used to have their own source and subdomain, but we've transferred them which has several advantages:

* When reading about community calls, you're looking at the same design than when reading tech notes which makes us happy since we like our website. Besides, thanks to the footer and header, you're more prone to bouncing on over parts of the website. The [community calls list](/commcalls) list and [individual pages](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2018-12-18/) use partials from the rest of the website, and our Hugo experience. In each community call page, the video recording is for instance embedded!

* Community calls are now more similar to blog posts and tech notes, and are cross-listed via their tags and authors so that they're more easy to find.

## Feed updates

If you want to keep up with our production, you can subscribe to different feeds (or [our newsletter](https://news.ropensci.org/) since it includes mentions of recent posts!).

### All the feeds

Our website has both RSS and JSON feeds. We added a [JSON feed](https://jsonfeed.org/), feed format introduced in May last year, because we could and because some people might like that. 

* RSS feeds https://ropensci.org/blog/index.xml, https://ropensci.org/technotes/index.xml

* JSON feeds https://ropensci.org/blog/index.json, https://ropensci.org/technotes/index.json

Here's [how we added the JSON feeds](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/pull/315).

### Not too much content for R-Bloggers

R-Bloggers feed https://ropensci.org/rbloggers/index.xml

We created an [R-Bloggers page which only outputs XML](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/rbloggers/_index.md), with [an XML template](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/rbloggers/rss.xml) ensuring this RSS feed is a full RSS feed contrary to the rest of our website that uses Hugo default RSS feeds with excerpts. We do not filter posts by category which means this not-so-R post (but still a bit R, thanks to our explaining how to browse our R stuff ;o) will appear in R-Bloggers, but we might do that later on.

## Twitter friendliness

While Twitter is not the only platform on which our content is shared, it is an important player so we've upped our Twitter game with two edits.

{{< tweet 1073519094958313472>}}

We've worked on adding Twitter metadata to our [head partial](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/partials/head.html) so when tweeting links from the website you get a pretty card (see above). We've used [resources listed in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/issues/290#issue-367542204) and [Twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) on Netlify preview links. Whilst updating the head partial we realized not all our pages used it so we homogeneized all pages. Some of our pages like [about](/about) have fancy stuff that's not Markdown based, but we now handle that with partials listed in YAML and then called from the [single.html default template](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/_default/single.html). Here [the source of our about page](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/about.md).

{{< tweet 953090299819118592 >}}

We _put a bird on it_, in Mara Averick's words, i.e. we now add a Twitter icon near authors' names when their metadata contains a Twitter username (have you noticed the bird near my name at the top of this post?). That happens [in the authors.html partial](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/partials/authors.html). Authors pages also link to Twitter accounts. By the way if you're ever authored a post for us feel free to open a pull request updating your metadata, e.g. if you were Ignasi Bartomeus you'd update [this file](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/authors/ignasi-bartomeus/_index.md).

## A calendar automatically up-to-date

Have you noticed [our calendar of events](/events)? It has its [own page](/events) but is also displayed from several other places of the website. We used to have a clunky calendar update workflow. Now, events information are stored as YAML in content/events, see [this example](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/events/2019-01-15-rstudioconf.md), and the [calendar partial](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/partials/calendar.html) creates an HTML table from all events and community calls between _now_ (Hugo `now` function) and one year from now. We [trigger one website build per day thanks to a Zapier Netlify integration](https://zapier.com/apps/netlify/integrations). 

Each event also gets its own page which allows displaying more information than in the calendar table, e.g. read more about [what Karthik Ram and Jeroen Ooms will be up to at rstudio::conf](https://ropensci.org/events/2019-01-15-rstudioconf/).

## Conclusion

In the last months, our website got more pages, list of pages and cross-references, JSON feeds, and Twitter metadata. It should have gotten nicer for you to browse and we hope you'll never leave it! We're open to more suggestions of improvements, in the comments below or in [roweb2 issue tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/).
