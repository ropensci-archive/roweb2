The [`drake` R package](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is not only a reproducible research solution, but also a serious high-performance computing engine. The [package website](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/) introduces [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), and this technical note draws from the guides on high-performance computing and timing in the [`drake` manual](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/drake-manual).

### You can help!

Some of these features are brand new, and others are newly refactored. The [GitHub version](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) has all the advertised functionality, but it needs more testing and development before I can submit it to CRAN in good conscience. New issues such as [r-lib/processx#113](http://github.com/r-lib/processx/issues/113) and [HenrikBengtsson/future#226](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/226) seem to affect [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), and more may emerge. If you use [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) for your own work, please consider supporting the project by field-testing the claims below and posting feedback [here](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/369).

### Let drake schedule your targets.

A typical workflow is a sequence of interdependent data transformations.

When you call `make()` on this project, [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) takes care of `"raw_data.xlsx"`, then `raw_data`, and then `data` in sequence. Once `data` completes, `fit` and `hist` can launch in parallel, and then  `"report.md"` begins once everything else is done. It is [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s responsibility to deduce this order of execution, hunt for ways to parallelize your work, and free you up to focus on the substance of your research.

### Activate parallel processing.

Simply set the `jobs` argument to an integer greater than 1. The following `make()` recruits multiple processes on your local machine.

```r
make(plan, jobs = 2)
```

For parallel deployment to a computing cluster ([SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), [TORQUE](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/), [SGE](http://www.univa.com/products/), etc.) [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) calls on packages [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future), [`batchtools`](https://github.com/mllg/batchtools), and [`future.batchtools`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools). First, create a [`batchtools` template file](https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/tree/master/inst/templates) to declare your resource requirements and [environment modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/). There are built-in example files in [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), but you will likely need to tweak your own by hand.

```r
drake_batchtools_tmpl_file("slurm") # Writes batchtools.slurm.tmpl.
```

Next, tell [`future.batchtools`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools) to talk to the cluster.

```r
library(future.batchtools)
future::plan(batchtools_slurm, template = "batchtools.slurm.tmpl")
```

Finally, set `make()`'s `parallelism` argument equal to `"future"` or `"future_lapply"`.

```r
make(plan, parallelism = "future", jobs = 8)
```

### Choose a scheduling algorithm.

The `parallelism` argument of `make()` controls not only where to deploy the workers, but also how to schedule them. The following table categorizes the 7 options.

|                       | Deploy: local | Deploy: remote |
| --------------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| <b>Schedule: persistent</b> | "mclapply", "parLapply" | "future_lapply" |
| <b>Schedule: transient</b>  | | "future", "Makefile" |
| <b>Schedule: staged</b>     | "mclapply_staged", "parLapply_staged" | |
<br>

#### Staged scheduling

[`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s first custom parallel algorithm was staged scheduling. It was easier to implement than the other two, but the workers run in lockstep. In other words, all the workers pick up their targets at the same time, and each worker has to finish its target before any worker can move on. The following animation illustrates the concept.

<div style = "text-align: center">
<br>
<iframe width="700" height="434" src="https://www.powtoon.com/embed/dQKbGttIYud/"></iframe>
<br>
</div>

But despite weak parallel efficiency, staged scheduling remains useful because of its low overhead. Without the bottleneck of a formal master process, staged scheduling blasts through armies of tiny conditionally independent targets. Consider it if the bulk of your work is finely diced and [perfectly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel), maybe if your dependency graph is tall and thin.

<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(drake)

N <- 500

gen_data <- function() {
  tibble(a = seq_len(N), b = 1, c = 2, d = 3)
}

plan_data <- drake_plan(
  data = gen_data()
)

plan_sub <-
  gen_data() %>%
  transmute(
    target = paste0("data", a),
    command = paste0("data[", a, ", ]")
  )

plan <- bind_rows(plan_data, plan_sub)
plan
## # A tibble: 501 x 2
##    target command   
##    <chr>  <chr>     
##  1 data   gen_data()
##  2 data1  data[1, ] 
##  3 data2  data[2, ] 
##  4 data3  data[3, ] 
##  5 data4  data[4, ] 
##  6 data5  data[5, ] 
##  7 data6  data[6, ] 
##  8 data7  data[7, ] 
##  9 data8  data[8, ] 
## 10 data9  data[9, ] 
## # ... with 491 more rows

config <- drake_config(plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)
</code></pre>

#### Persistent scheduling

Persistent scheduling is brand new to [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). Here, `make(jobs = 2)` deploys three processes: two workers and one master. Whenever a worker is idle, the master assigns it the next target whose dependencies are fully ready. The workers keep running until no more targets remain. See the animation below.

<br>
</center>

#### Transient scheduling

If the time limits of your cluster are too strict for persistent workers, consider transient scheduling, another new arrival. Here, `make(jobs = 2)` starts a brand new worker for each individual target. See the following video.

<div style = "text-align: center">
<br>
<iframe width="700" height="434" src="https://www.powtoon.com/embed/cHIdOqudELB/"></iframe>
<br>
</div>

### How many jobs should you choose?

The `predict_runtime()` function can help. Let's revisit the [`mtcars` example](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/tree/master/inst/examples/mtcars).

<div style = "text-align: center">
<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/cdacd23e/docs/images/outdated.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>
</div>

Let's also 

1. Plan for non-staged scheduling,
2. Assume each non-file target (black circle) takes 2 hours to build, and
3. Rest assured that everything else is super quick.

When we declare the runtime assumptions with the `known_times` argument and cycle over a reasonable range of `jobs`, `predict_runtime()` paints a clear picture.

<div style = "text-align: center">
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/21c41083/images/times.png"
style = "width: 600px" alt="times">
</div>

`jobs = 4` is a solid choice. Any fewer would slow us down, and the next 2-hour speedup would take double the `jobs` and the hardware to back it up. Your choice of `jobs` for `make()` ultimately depends on the runtime you can tolerate and the computing resources at your disposal.

### Thanks!

When I attended [`RStudio::conf(2018)`](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) relied almost exclusively on staged scheduling. [Kirill MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/krlmlr) spent hours on site and hours afterwards helping me approach the problem and educating me on [priority queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue), [message queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue), and the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). His generous help paved the way for [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s latest enhancements.
