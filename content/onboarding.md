rOpenSci's [suite of packages](/packages/) is partly contributed by staff members and partly contributed by community members, which means the suite stems from a great diversity of skills and experience of developers. How to ensure quality for the whole set? That's where our peer-review system comes into play: packages contributed by the community undergo a **transparent, constructive, non adversarial and open review process**. For that process relying mostly on **volunteer work**, _[associate editors](/about#team)_ manage the incoming flow and ensure progress of submissions; _authors_ create, submit and improve their package; _[reviewers](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding#reviewers)_, two per submission, examine the software code and user experience.

Technically, we make the most of [GitHub](https://github.com/) infrastructure: each package onboarding process is an issue in the [ropensci/onboarding GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/). For instance, click [here](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/24) to read the onboarding review thread of the `ropenaq` package: the process is an ongoing conversation until acceptance of the package, with two external reviews as important milestones. Furthermore, we use GitHub features such as the use of issue templates (as submission templates), and labelling which we use to track progress of submissions (from editor checks to approval).
