[AntWeb](http://www.antweb.org/) is a repository that boasts a wealth of natural history data, digital images, and specimen records on ant species from a large community of museum curators.


### Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("AntWeb")
```

or you can install the latest development version.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("devtools")
install_github("ropensci/AntWeb")
```

### Usage


#### Searching through the database

As with most of our packages, there are several ways to search through an API. In the case of AntWeb, you can search by a genus or full species name or by other taxonomic ranks like sub-phylum.

To obtain data on any taxonomic group, you can make a request using the `aw_data()` function. It's possible to search easily by a taxonomic rank (e.g. a genus) or by passing a complete scientific name.

__Searching by Genus__

To get data on an ant genus found widely through Central and South America

```{r}
library("AntWeb")
leaf_cutter_ants  <- aw_data(genus = "acromyrmex")
leaf_cutter_ants$count
```

__Searching by species__

You can request data on any particular species

```{r}
(acanthognathus_df <- aw_data(scientific_name = "acanthognathus brevicornis"))
```

You can also limit queries to observation records that have been geoferenced

```{r}
(acanthognathus_df_geo <- aw_data(genus = "acanthognathus", species = "brevicornis", georeferenced = TRUE))
```


It's also possible to search for records around any location by specifying a search radius.

This will search for data on a 2 km radius around that latitude/longitude

```{r}
data_by_loc <- aw_coords(coord = "37.76,-122.45", r = 2)
```

#### Mapping ant specimen data

As with the previous ecoengine package, you can also visualize location data for any set of species. Adding `georeferenced = TRUE` to a data retrieval call will filter out any data points without location information. Once retrieved the data are mapped with the open source [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) and pushed to your default browser. Maps and associated `geoJSON` files are also saved to a location specified (or defaults to your `/tmp` folder). This feature is only available on the development version on GitHub (`0.5.2` or greater; see above on how to install) and will be available from CRAN in version `0.6`

```{r eval=FALSE}
acd <- aw_data(genus = "acanthognathus")
aw_map(acd)
```
