[Europe PMC](http://europepmc.org/) covers life science literature and
gives access to open access full texts. Europe
PMC ingests all PubMed content and extends its index with other sources,
including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the agricultural
literature, or Biological Patents.

### Search Europe PMC

The search covers both metadata (e.g. abstracts or title) and full texts. To
build your query, please refer to the comprehensive guidance on how to search
Europe PMC: <http://europepmc.org/help>. Simply provide your query in the Europe
PMC search syntax to `epmc_search()`.

By default, `epmc_search` returns 100 records. To adjust the limit, simply use
the `limit` parameter.

### Examples

For instance, search for abstracts and full texts that mention
[`Gabi-Kat`](https://www.gabi-kat.de/),  a Flanking Sequence Tag
(FST)-based database for T-DNA insertion mutants:

```{r}
epmc_search(query = 'Gabi-Kat')
```

Get PLOS Genetics (ISSN:1553-7404) articles that cross-reference EMBL:

```{r}
epmc_search(query = 'ISSN:1553-7404 HAS_EMBL:y')
```

Use [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) to search for personal publications:

```{r}
epmc_search(query = 'AUTHORID:"0000-0002-7635-3473"', limit = 1000)
```

**Include MeSH and UniProt synonyms**

You may also want to include synonyms when searching Europe PMC. If
`synonym = TRUE` MeSH and UniProt synonyms are searched as well.

```{r}
# with snyonyms
epmc_search('aspirin', synonym = TRUE)

# without synonyms
epmc_search('aspirin', synonym = FALSE)
```

**Output types**

`epmc_search()` supports the following output types :

**Parsed key metadata (default)**

Key metadata parsed as non-nested tibble:

```{r}
epmc_search('Gabi-Kat', output = 'parsed')
```

In addition to fetch bibliographic metadata, the parsed output also helps you
to get a general overview about additional information types that are offered by
Europe PMC and which can be retrieved through other `europepmc`-functions.
Columns inform whether open access full texts (`isOpenAccess`), cross-links to
other EBI databases (`hasDbCrossReferences`), text-mined terms (`hasTextMinedTerms`)
or references (`hasReferences`) are available.

**IDs**

List of literature database identifier including PMID:

```{r}
epmc_search('Gabi-Kat', output = 'id_list')
```

**Record details**

Full metadata as list. Please be aware that these lists can become very large, and fetching these data from Europe PMC therefore takes some time.

```{r}
my_list <- epmc_search('Gabi-Kat', output = 'raw', limit = 10)
# display the structure for one list element
str(my_list[[10]])
```

**Get results number**

Count hits before with `epmc_hits` to define limit. For example, get list of ids
that represent articles referencing DataCite DOIs:

```{r}
query <- "ACCESSION_TYPE:doi"
epmc_hits(query)
# set limit to 10 records
my_data <- epmc_search(query = query, limit = 10)
head(my_data)
attr(my_data, "hit_count")
```

You may also use `epmc_profile` to retrieve a summary of hit counts.

```{r}
epmc_profile(query = 'malaria')
```

**Get article details**

In addition to key metadata, `epmc_details` also returns full metadata
providing more comprehensive information on the article-level. By default,
PubMed / Medline index is searched.


```{r}
epmc_details(ext_id = '24270414')
```

Show author details including ORCID:

```{r}
epmc_details(ext_id = '14756321')$author_details
```

**Get citation counts and citing publications**

Citing publications from the Europe PMC index can be retrieved like this:

```{r}
my_cites <- epmc_citations('9338777')
my_cites
# hits:
attr(my_cites, 'hit_count')
```

Please note, that citation counts are often smaller than those held by toll-
access services such as Web of Science or Scopus because the number of
reference sections indexed for Europe PMC considerably differs due to the
lack of full text accessibility.

**Get reference section**

Europe PMC indexes more than 5 million reference sections.

```{r}
epmc_refs('PMC3166943', data_src = 'pmc')
```

Tip: add `has_reflist:y` to your search string in `epmc_search` to make sure
you only get publications whose reference sections are accessible through
Europe PMC.

**Retrieve links to other EBI databases**

Cross-links to EBI databases are either manually curated (ENA, InterPro, PDB,
IntAct, ChEMBL, ChEBI and ArrayExpress) or automatically gathered through
text-mining (European Nucleotide Archive, UniProt, PDB, OMIM, RefSNP, RefSeq,
Pfam, InterPro, Ensembl, ArrayExpress and data DOIs).

Before retrieving the links, please check availability and sources first:

```{r}
epmc_db_count('12368864')
```

Add `has_xrefs:y` or to your search string in `epmc_search` to make sure
you only get publications with cross-references to EBI databases.

Select database and get links:

```{r}
epmc_db('12368864', db = 'embl')
```

**Get text-mined terms**

Text-mined terms that can be accessed via Europe PMC are mapped against
controlled vocabularies like [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org/).

Before retrieving these terms, please check availability and vocabularies
first:

```{r}
epmc_tm_count('25249410')
```

Select vocabulary to retrieve the terms:

```{r}
epmc_tm('25249410', semantic_type = 'GO_TERM')
```

**Links to external sources**

With the External Link services, Europe PMC allows third parties to publish
links from Europe PMC to other webpages. Current External Link providers,
whose id can be found through Europe PMC's Advanced Search interface, include
Wikipedia, Dryad Digital Repository or the institutional repo of Bielefeld
University. For more information, see <http://europepmc.org/labslink>.

Check availability and number of links:

```{r}
epmc_lablinks_count('PMC3986813', data_src = 'pmc')
```

Get links from Wikipedia (`lab_id = '1507'`)

```{r}
epmc_lablinks('20301687', lab_id = '1507')
```

**Full text access**

Full texts are in XML format and are only provided for the Open Access subset
of Europe PMC. They can be retrieved by the PMCID.

```{r}
epmc_ftxt('PMC3257301')
```

Books, fetched through the PMID or the 'NBK' book number, can also be loaded
as XML into R for further text-mining activities using `epmc_ftxt_book()`.


Please check full-text availability before calling this method either with `epmc_search()` or `epmc_details()`.
