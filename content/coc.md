<p class="bodybig">rOpenSci is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from participating in the project at the discretion of the staff.</p>
                    <p class="bodybig">This Code of Conduct applies to all participants, including rOpenSci staff and leadership and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, the rOpenSci discussion forum, Slack channels, and Twitter.</p>


<center> **rOpenSci participants agree to:** </center>

* Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow community members.

* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any member of the project team in person.

* Take care of each other. Alert a member of the project team if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

The rOpenSci Code of Conduct Committee includes Stefanie Butland (rOpenSci Community Manager), Scott Chamberlain (rOpenSci Co-founder and Technical Lead) and Kara Woo (independent community member). If any event attendee or project participant engages in harassing behavior, the Committee may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the event/project. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it via email to `conduct@ropensci.org`. Your email will go to all three Committee members. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should report it with a concise description of your grievance.)
