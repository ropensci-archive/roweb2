The aim of this Community Call is to help people learn about using rOpenSci's R packages to access and analyze taxonomy and biodiversity data, and to recognize the breadth and depth of their applications. We also aim to learn from the discussion how we might improve these tools. Presentations will start with an introduction to the topic and details on some specific packages and we'll hear from several people about their "use cases in the wild".
