description: Helping people learn about rOpenSci’s packages to access and analyze
  taxonomy and biodiversity data, and to recognize the breadth and depth of their
  applications. Presentations will start with an introduction and details on some
  specific packages and we’ll hear from several people about their “use cases in the
  wild”.
