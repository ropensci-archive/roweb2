description: 'To the uninitiated, software testing may seem variously boring, daunting or bogged down in obscure terminology. However, it has the potential to be enormously useful for people developing software at any level of expertise, and can often be put into practice with relatively little effort. We are aiming to address needs on a continuum, whether you are getting started with testing, or it’s already at the core of your development process. Read the announcement blog post for speaker details.'
