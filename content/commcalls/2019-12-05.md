description: To the uninitiated, software testing may seem variously boring, daunting
  or bogged down in obscure terminology. However, it has the potential to be enormously
  useful for people developing software at any level of expertise, and can often be
  put into practice with relatively little effort. We are aiming to address needs
  on a continuum, whether you are getting started with testing, or it’s already at
  the core of your development process. Read the announcement blog post for speaker
  details.
