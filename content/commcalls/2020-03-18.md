description: Package development often seems like the end goal, but ongoing
  maintenance is crucial in keeping a package alive and useful. Packages
  maintained by a single developer risk being lost as the developer's situation
  and priorities change. In the interest of software sustainability, ideally 
  each package would have more than one maintainer, but this is relatively rare. 
  Join this community call to hear more about package maintenance through tips 
  and tricks, best practices for encouraging contributions, and trials and 
  tribulations of taking over maintenance of existing packages.
