description: rOpenSci’s community is increasingly international and multilingual.
  While we have operated primarily in English, we now receive submissions of packages
  from authors whose primary language is not. As we expand our community in this way,
  we want to learn from the experience of other organizations. How can we manage our
  peer-review process and open-source projects to be welcoming to non-native English
  speakers? Our guest speakers included Rayna Harris, who has co-led work with The
  Carpentries in internationalization of curricula, and Emilio Bruna, who as editor-in-chief
  of Biotropica, manages a journal with a heavily tropical-country audience and authorship
  base.
