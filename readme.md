# rOpenSci website

Welcome to the new (October 2017) website for the rOpenSci project. Our old website ([repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb), [site](http://legacy.ropensci.org/)) is now archived and all new content should be added to this repository. For any issues with the site including typos or rendering issues, please file an [issue](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/issues) or send a pull-request. The site automatically deploys once pull requests are merged.

### Contributing a blog post


To contribute a blog post (üôè):

See [editorial suggestions](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2#blog-post-editorial-suggestions) below

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new file in `/content/blog/YEAR-MONTH-DAY-short-slug.md`
3. Your post must include YAML in this format:



```
---
slug: "treestartr"
title: Generating reasonable starting trees for complex phylogenetic analyses
package_version: 0.1.0
authors:
  - name: April Wright
    url: https://paleantology.com/the-wright-lab/
    twitter: WrightingApril
date: 2018-12-11
categories: blog
topicid:
tags:
- software-peer-review
- r
- community
- software
- packages
- treestartr
- phylogeny
- paleontology
- fossils
- divergence-time
---
```

5. If your blog post has any images (or other assets), create a folder under `themes/ropensci/static/img/blog-images/` with the pattern `<DATE-SLUG>` (e.g. `2018-12-11-treestartr`) and place them there. To reference any of these objects in your post,  use `/img/blog-images/<DATE-SLUG>/name-of-image.png`. If the paths are correct, you should see the preview render correctly (see next step).

6. Once you've drafted your blog post, you can preview locally using Hugo or skip to the next step to preview on the pull request. See [technical notes](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/readme.md#installation-requirements) section for installation instructions if you wish to preview locally.

7. Send a pull request from your fork one week prior to the post date to allow time for review. Netlify will start building the new version of the site within seconds and you can preview you changes to make sure everything looks as intended. Otherwise push additional fixes till things look right.

8. Tag a rOpenSci staff member to review your pull request (@stefaniebutland, @sckott, @jeroen, or @karthik)

#### Blog post editorial suggestions

For a post about your peer-reviewed package you should:
- browse other posts about peer-reviewed packages with tag '[software-peer-review](https://ropensci.org/tags/software-peer-review/)'
- consider giving some narrative on motivation for creating the package and share an interesting use case
- acknowledge reviewers by name with links to their GitHub or Twitter; no need to explicitly acknowledge the editor
- acknowledge other contributors, if any
- consider ending by pointing to open issues that readers might work on
- include YAML tag "software-peer-review" and tags that were topic labels in your package review
- browse [other tags](https://ropensci.org/tags/), and re-use either the plural or singular form of an existing tag e.g. "databases" exists, so use that, rather than "database"
- if you would like an author's twitter account to be linked from a twitter icon, in YAML under `- name: <name>`, add `twitter: <twitterhandle>` and use a non-twitter link such as GitHub, website, or ORCID for `url: <link>` (example [in markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/roweb2/master/content/blog/2018-11-13-antarctic.md) | [rendered](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/11/13/antarctic/))
- if you would like a specific image from your post to be featured in tweets that include a link to your post, add to YAML `twitterImg: img/blog-images/<DATE-SLUG>/name-of-image.png`


For a post about your experience as a reviewer you can browse other posts with tag '[reviewer](https://ropensci.org/tags/reviewer/)'

### Installation requirements

There are no requirements to simply add a post/fix and push to GitHub for a render preview on a pull request. However, if you wish to preview the site locally, you must install Hugo.

#### Installing Hugo for local preview

The current version of `hugo` on the server uses is defined in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml). To install hugo locally:

```
brew install hugo
```

Then run `hugo serve` in the repo directory to start a local server on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313). To view a future-dated blog post, use `hugo serve -F`.


#### Updating page templates

For other website issues and updates, see [developer-notes](developer-notes.md)
